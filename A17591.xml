         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Novve that you fight more egerly than vviſely in a Croſſe quarrell, ye lie ſo open to be croſſebytten, that the cauſe it ſelfe and your poore credit go to the ground together. For though ye vſe to face men vvithal, ſuch termes and titles of eſtimacion, as rather of ſome be gotten by continuaunce, than giuen by deſert: as Bacheler of Lavve and ſtudent in Diuinitie: yet if ye had ioyned more Logique vvith your Lavve, your reaſons should not haue runne ſo lavvleſſe (as they do:) or if you had remembred your olde humanitie, you vvould not haue ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned your nevve diuinitie, vvith ſuch ſlaunders and lies, ſuch

But mans lavve ſtriketh ſo great a ſtroke vvith you, that Goddes rule &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience is excluded from you: and being ſo depe in your popish diuinitie, you haue forgotten al chriſtian huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.

Doctor, and hath othervviſe ſome opinion of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (vvordes in deede at vvil) he muſt needes be thought to ſay ſomething. But hovv this ſomthing in effect is nothing, the Byshop of Salisburie aboundantly doth proue. Next to the Maſter, came the vvorthy Scholer: and yet vvorthy <hi>Man</hi> he gaue but a <hi>Dor.</hi> VVe doe eaſly ſee in vvhoſe forge he vvas framed: he ſauours of the fier that flevve out before: and yet neither of them both for all their heate of railing, hath any vvarmth of religion. His proues I paſſe to the reproufe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished abrode already. Onely I am ſory M. Novvell had not a more learned aduerſarie. Then commes in M.

<pb facs="tcp:7817:3"/> Entellum.</hi> Nay. <hi>Hinnului Leonem.</hi> Yet he ſaith that he vvil but fight vvith a Penknife, He vvill ouerthrovv vvith a breath if he can. O noble courage. He leaueth the bloudy launces and terrible halbardes, for Hardy Harding: and Doughty Dorman: he himſelf vvil come after, and blovve his enimies afore him. If I should deale vvith this daungerous bugge, I vvould for all that, prouide my ſelfe of a longer ſvvorde, for belike he hath a very ſtrong breath: and yet vvith a Bodkin he may be borne ouer. I vvill not touch this proud pecockes taile, I vvill leaue it at leaſure to be pulled of an other. To make vp the meſſe, ſteps out M. Stapleton: he vvil not ſtand by, and be but a looker on: hauing therefore neuer a vveapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his ovvne, he runs to a Ruffian, and borrovves his ſvvord. He hath put on a nevv ſcabbard on it: he hath varnished the hiltes. The blade it ſelf is al to be hackt. It hath bene already in ſo many frayes, and borne avvay ſo many blovves, that it is novve ſcarcely able to ſcratch. This yong man therefore vvil ſight vvith the ſcabberde. But if a man giue him a drie blovv or tvvo (as for his vvilfulneſſe he vvell deſerueth) vve shal ſee hereafter vvhat fence he hath for it.

For if the groundwork be ſhaken once, whervpon we builde our health and ſaluation (which is the affiaunce in Chriſt our God, and credite to his worde) then enters our ennimy with banner diſplayed, and beateth vs downe to the pit of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

As Moſes went vp into the mount Syna and there receyued the Law tables, whereof the author God him ſelf ſhould be: So <hi>Minos</hi> afterward among the Grecians hyding him ſelfe a while, in Iupiters caue, came forth at length, and gaue them lawes, from mighty Ioue, as he pretended. And to the ende, the

If we threaten venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the miſbeleuers, and extreme torment of hell fier, the Diuels limmes laugh vs to ſcorne againe, and doe reſemble it to Plato his Purgatorie, or to the ſcalding of <hi>Pyriphlegeton,</hi> a riuer ſo deuiſed by the heathen folke, to burne in hell wyth flames vnquenchable. Such ſleights hath Sathan to put vs in ſecuritie of any further payne: to pull vs from the hope of perfecter eſtate, that here we may liue, as the Diuell would haue vs: in the ende to receiue as the Diuel can rewarde vs. And he hath not wanted his inſtrumentes of olde. He hath made himſelf miniſters from time to time, that in the worlds eye were moſt worthy reuerence, and likelier than the reſt to

For being in Babilon, they went as nere as they could to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rytes of Gentilitie: &amp; reſtored agayne vnto the land of promiſe, vnder Antiochus they fell agayne. Such is the violent perſuaſion of error, ſuch is the force of ſuperſticion, that aſſone as euer occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is miniſtred, our corrupt nature enclineth to it. Wherof we néede to fetch no further proufe, than our owne dayes.

For .xiiij. yeare together, as by good depoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s it is to be ſéene, he preached againſt the Popes ſupremacie, vehemently, py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, earneſtly, very earneſtly, forwardly: but as ſone as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer oportunitie ſerued him, he brought (in the Diuels name) the Idol in agayne. What ſhall I ſpeake of mens priuate doings? generally we heard in our Ioſias raigne, when he had pulled downe the hie places, that our affections had bene layd to lowe, that we had bene deceiued. And as for Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, pardons, and ſuche ydle toyes, who would defende them? who would not confeſſe, that they had bene abuſed by them? yet in that terrible Interraigne of Antichriſt, a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage in Wales was ſtraight erected.

Nor it ought to ſéeme any maruel, that they which from among the Gentiles were cured of our Sauiour, did theſe things: where as we haue ſéene the pictures of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, of Paule and Peter, of Chriſt himſelfe, reſerued in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, ſet forth with coloures, bycauſe men of olde time (by cuſtome that came from the Gentiles) were wonte to honour on this ſorte them, that they thought to be the helpers and preſeruers of them. In which wordes .ij. things are eſpecially to be obſerued. Firſt that erecting of Images came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſme, when ſuch as were newly conuerted to the chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, could not clearly be weaned from all their Gentilitie: no more than we returning from popery, can willingly leaue the rags of Rome. And ſurely many things might be borne withall in them, which being farre ſtepte in yeares, came at length to the truth, and hardly forſoke that, that all their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues they had bene inured to. And therfore as in Paganiſme they made Images of them that had well deſerued: ſo in Chriſtianitie, they did the like obſeruaunce to Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Furthermore by the teſtimony of <hi>Euſebius</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7817:14"/> that in his time (which was thrée hundred and .xxv. yeare after Chriſt,) neyther Images nor pictures, nor any ſuch counterfets, were brought into the Churches: nor yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued of all Chriſtians, (for he made a wonder and ſtraunge ſight, of that that he there ſaw) but onely priuately ſome toke it vp: not for religion, not for Gods ſeruice, but for a wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their owne good wils: as we in our houſes haue the pictures of them whome we holde deareſt, and doe loue beſte. The firſt that euer we do reade of, to haue brought in Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry into the Church, was <hi>Pontius Paulinus</hi> a byſhop of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> which liued in the raigne of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> &amp; <hi>Martian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, foure hundred and thrée ſcore yeare after Chriſt. The occaſion of his inconſiderate zeale was this. The people were accuſtomed euery yeare once, to celebrate the feaſte of <hi>Faelix</hi> the martir: and in the church to banquet &amp; make good chéere. The byſhop ſeing ſome abuſe therein, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end he might kepe them from ſurfetting and riot, cauſed the walles of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be painted with ſtories, taken out of the olde teſtament: that they beholding and conſidering the pictures, might giue themſelues the more to temperance and ſobrietie. About the ſame time, <hi>Prudentius</hi> reporteth, how he ſaw paynted &amp; por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed in the Church, the hiſtorie of S. Caſſian. Thus Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry came from priuate houſes, to publique places: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> payn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting alſo, to emboſſing: yet neyther priuately nor openly, paynted or emboſſed, we reade that they were honored: Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it was about ſix hundreth yeare after Chriſt, when through barbaritie, of Gothes and Vandales (which burſt into Italy, ſpoyled all places, and burned libraries) vertue decayed, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning went to wreck, Religion was little ſéene vnto: Then by commen ignoraunce of Gods worde, negligence of the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and vnruly raigne of barbarous aliens, Images were not onely ſet vp, but began to be worſhipped. Therfore <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renus</hi> byſhop of Maſſile the head towne of <hi>Gallia Narbonen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> now called the Prouince, ſéeing the people by occaſion of
<pb facs="tcp:7817:15"/> Images, fal to Idolatry, brake al that were in that City, to pieces: were they either of Chriſt, or of his ſaincts.

And as this was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt learned byſhop, that did allow the open hauing of Images in Churches: ſo vpon him, doe all image worſhippers at this day ground their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.<note place="margin">Epiſt. libr <hi>7</hi> Indict. <hi>2.</hi> Cap. <hi>109.</hi>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7817:15"/> horrible daunger. Al which matters are in the diſcourſe more at large opened. Gregory therefore, if he had liued but a while longer, &amp; ſéene the leaſt parte of al the miſeries, which all the worlde hath felt ſince, onely for maintenance of thoſe Mammots: he would, and well might haue curſed himſelfe, for leauing behinde him ſo leude a Preſident.

If the ſhape do worke an vnderſtanding in vs, bycauſe it is made, as the Image of a man, or of a woman: then why not one Image teach as well as another?

We haue ſéene Images in euery Church: ſpecially of Ladies, and of the Croſſe: then, why did they gadde from London, to Wilſdon, from Wilſdon to Walſingham, to ſéeke for other Ladies? Coulde not the one teache as muche as the other? Their eloquence, their voyce, and diligence, was all alyke. Why did my countrey men, from their own pariſhes, where they had croſſes ynowe, come on pilgrimage ſo oft, to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Croſſe of Ludlowe? Why did they runne from euery cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their owne countrey, to the Roode of Cheſter? Vnleſſe ye will ſay (as many thought in déede) that the yron chayne, of that ſturdy champion, put about the necke, might ſaue them from the hempen halter: which other could not doe. Then muſt it néedes be ſomewhat elſe than teaching, that maketh this people, to giue vnequal honor, to ſignes of equal ſaincts. Alexander the Copperſmyth will come in with his band, and there will be a ſtyrre, which ſhall be the deareſt <hi>Diana</hi> to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Otherwiſe, they woulde no more crouche to this Image or that, than they do to the Bible, which teacheth (me thinke) as much as they. Agayne if they teach, let me aſke them, whom?
<pb facs="tcp:7817:18"/> Learned? or vnlearned? If they teache the vnlearned, howe can they knowe the picture of Chriſt, from the picture of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Bycauſe of the Croſſe? Why, both were crucified. But not after one ſorte. Howe knowe they that? They haue learned it of other. But here they haue loſte the ſtate that they were in, for they are nowe become to be learned. Of other alſo they might haue learned moe leſſons than that, and of more certaynty. But the crowne of Thorne, the wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the ſyde, doe make the matter playne. Alas howe ſhall the ſimple knowe, that Chriſt was crowned, was wounded for vs? They haue hearde it of M. Parſon: let M. Parſon then preache it to them. If he preache not a truthe with his tong, the picture by and by will teache a lye. I remember howe Stephen Gardiner<note place="margin">Stephen Gardiner</note> (whoſe authoritie I vſe in aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of him who was Vſher of the ſchoole where he was Byſhoppe of the Sée) was fowly once abuſed by an Image. Where as the King in his great ſeale was ſet on both ſydes, on the one ſyde as in warre the chiefe captaine, on the other ſyde as in peace the liege ſoueraine: that famous byſhop had found out there S. George on horſebacke, which the grauer neuer made in it, nor the Sealer neuer ſealed with it. Yet in his letters to M. Vaugham of Porteſmouth, aunſwered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward by the Counſell, concerning the ſame matter which we haue now in hand: He vſeth theſe words. <hi>He that can not reade the ſcripture about the Kings broade ſeale, eyther by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he can not reade it at all, or bycauſe the vvay doth not expreſſe it, yet he can reade S. George on horſebacke on the one ſyde.</hi> If his learned Lordſhippe, could not reade aright ſuch a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Image, if the inſcription could eſcape his eyes: no maruell if the lay people were deceyued in the like. I will tell you what theſe bokes doe teach them. Carnall and groſſe ymaginations of God: and giue further occaſion to féede their owne wicked humour. When <hi>Amadys</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amadys.</note> a Goldſmith of London, lay at the poynt of death, his Parſon preſented him
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7817:18"/> with the Croſſe, to put him at the leaſt, in remembraunce of his maker. But what his remembrance was helped thereby, his anſwere declares. For he raiſed himſelf in his bed &amp; ſaid, <hi>What is the price of an ovvnce?</hi> Such is the fruite that the vnlearned receiue by Images, yea, though they be of the beſt ſorte. As for the learned, they haue better bokes: they nede not to be warned with ſuch ydle workemanſhip. A liuely I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage is more to purpoſe than a deade. And if the proportion and ſhape of a man, may moue vs, then why not of the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, rather than the deade? If I ſée a poore man ſtretched on the Croſſe in déede, enimies ſcorning him, power oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him: &amp; death aflicting him: he may for the remembrance doe me more good, and for perill leſſe harme. For I néede not to doubt Idolatrie to him. But if I nayle a dead picture, on the materiall Croſſe, and ſet it vp in the Church, my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie is little mended. I may peraduenture, and not like to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary but I ſhal be miſſe led by it. Now ſuppoſe it were ſo, that a Crucifixe in the Church did tel me in déede in moſt ſignificant and plaine letters, that Chriſt on the Croſſe died? what am I the better for that, vnleſſe I knowe that he dyed for me, and the meane how his death may be applyed to me? But thys by no picture can be expreſſed. The promiſes in the worde muſt declare me that, without the which nothing is the image, yea, worſe than nothing. Will ye then haue vs to be put in minde of our eſtate and condition, of oure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in Chriſt? No picture can repreſent it, no piece of metall can ſet out that, which all the preaching, all the wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the worlde, is not able ſufficiently to beate into oure dull and forgetfull heades.<note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> But ofte we ſée that by the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage or Storie, our memorie is holpen.

<pb facs="tcp:7817:19"/> Then alſo there ought not any ſuch forgetfulneſſe to reſte in vs: Chriſt hath willed vs thereof to be mindefull euer: we ſhould not ſtand in néede of more outwarde helpes, than he (expert of our infirmities) hath of his mercy prouided for vs. Conſider this with your ſelues, that if an Image be put, it is an Image of God, or an Image of man. God is inuiſible, &amp; hath no body: how can he then be portrayed? Shal we giue a ſhape to him, that hath no ſhape? <hi>The Lorde ſpake vnto you</hi> (ſayth Moſes) <hi>out of the middle of fier.</hi>

Howe can the infinite maieſtie and greatneſſe of God, incomprehenſible to mannes minde, much more not able to be compaſſed with the ſenſe, be expreſſed in a finite and little Image?

They ſo abhorre and deteſt all painting &amp; grauing of any Images, that they call, and verily beleue, the Chriſtians that onely delyte in them, to be Idolaters and worſhippers of Diuels. Wherefore, when I was in <hi>Chio,</hi> &amp; would haue perſuaded the embaſſators of the Turkes, which came thither to receiue tribute, (after I had brought them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Church) as touching Images, they would not agrée, but refuting all reaſon, this onely they affirmed, <hi>You vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship Idols.</hi> And ſurely Iewes and Turkes will neuer come to our religion, while theſe ſtumbling blockes of Images re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine amongſt vs, and lye in their way. Nowe that I haue proued, as well by the wordes of Scripture, as by the true ſenſe and meaning of it, ſo vnderſtode of all the faythful, that it is a piece of infidelitie, to haue an Image in place of Gods ſeruice: it might ſuffiſe to deciſe the controuerſie that is in hand. But an Image can not be made of Chriſt, vnleſſe it be a lying Image, as the Scripture peculiarly calleth Images lies, as I proued before. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For Chriſt is God and man. And ſince of the Godhead which is the moſt excellent parte, no I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage can be made, it is falſly called the Image of Chriſt: &amp; they that doe apply any honor to it, are mere Idolaters: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Chriſt thereby inferior to the Father: cleauing onely to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7817:22"/> his humanity, wher as we are by Chriſts own words co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that al ſhould ſo honor the ſonne, as they honor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father.<note place="margin">Io. 5.</note> But agaynſt this, a crafty Papiſt may reply and ſay, that by the ſame reaſon, it is not lawful to paynt a man, for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of ſoule and body: and the ſoule which is the chief part of him, no arte or cunning is able to expreſſe. But I anſwere to this, that the reaſon is nothing like. For the ſoule may be ſeuered from the body: as dayly, by death, we ſée experience: nor it is impietie to think vpon or beholde, the ſhape of a man without a ſoule: But the Diuinitie of Chriſt can not be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from his humanitie: neyther is it lawful to imagine an humanitie without a Diuinitie, leaſt we fall into the hereſie of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> as in the third Article, where I ſhall haue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſpeake of the Counſell aſſembled by commaundement of Conſtantine the fifth, at more large is opened. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And where as Chriſt hath caried his fleſh vppe into heauen with him, no more to be knowen according to the fleſhe, we fleſhly creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res do fall from his will, and make a counterfet of a mortall fleſhe, where as his, is glorified. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Furthermore vnknowen it is, what was the forme and countenaunce of Chriſt. So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places: ſo many Images, and euery one of them (as they affirme) the true and liuely Image of Chriſt, and yet neuer a one of them like to an other: wherefore as ſone as an Image of Chriſt is made, by and by a lye is made, which is forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by Gods worde. Wherefore ſince our Religion ought to be grounded vpon truth, Images which can not be without lies ought not to be made, or put to any vſe of Religion. Thus haue I declared the vnlawfulneſſe of Images, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect they are intollerable. Now a word for the folly of them, which among vs is nothing ſufferable.<note place="margin">Oratione contra Idol.</note>

If we ſeke for compariſons, &amp; will haue one thing ſet forth by an other, why ſhuld we not rather follow Chriſts inſtitution, than be addicted to our own deuiſes? Chriſt in the Scripture hath reſembled himſelfe to many of his creatures, which dayly &amp; hourely, are before our eyes: And can we not be contented with them, but make newe creatures of our owne heads, to put vs in minde of our bounden dueties? We ſée the light &amp; ſhining ſunne: and ſée we not the power of Chriſt in it? We ſee the wayes &amp; dores to our houſes: and ſée we not Chriſt the ready path to heauen? We ſée the hennes clocking of their chickens: &amp; ſée we not Chriſt continually calling vs? We ſèe pore ſhepherds féeding of their ſhéepe: and ſée we not Chriſt the true feder of our ſoules? We ſée our ſelues y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liuely Images, &amp; perfect cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfets of Chriſt himſelf: &amp; ſhal Chriſt be forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnleſſe we haue a crucifix? There is nothing I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you, but madneſſe in this meaning. Ther is nothing that can ſo liuely expreſſe the affects, (as I may terme them) &amp; qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Chriſt, as thoſe things, which he thought good to ſerue our vnderſtanding. Shal we then refuſe the more euident ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, &amp; fal to the darker ſignification? Shal we contemne Chriſt and his order, &amp; ſet ſo much ſtore by a blinde picture? <hi>Nero,</hi> I remember, was ſometime ſo wanton, <hi>vt gladiatorum pugnas ſpectaret in Smaragdo.</hi> He had an Emeraud in his ring, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> would giue to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eye the reſemblances of things that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.

But nothing can content the curious: &amp; the fleſh delighteth in hir own deuiſes. Thus is it proued that Images do not according to Gregories mind, teach: but in al reſpects be vaine &amp; fooliſh: &amp; if they did teach,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7817:23" rendition="simple:additions"/> yet by the ſcripture and word of God, ſuch ſcholemaſters are forbidden to vs. Now that they are honoured contrary to his minde: experience of long time hath proued, and the Popiſh doctrine hath confirmed.

But of theſe Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous déedes and doctrines, I ſhall haue occaſion hereafter to entreate. Suffiſeth now that I haue ſhewed, how the Diuel abuſeth the works of God to his own purpoſe: how Images haue crept into the Church: how necſſarily they are naught: both by the word of God, &amp; authority of good men condemned. And ſith they teache not, otherwiſe than lies: &amp; are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding honored, to the ſhame of vs, and derogation of gods glory, they ought in generall to be remoued from the place of perill: the place of Gods ſeruice. We muſt not giue place to our owne reaſon: we muſt not meaſure God with the line of our fanſies, but builde according to the plat layed before vs, &amp; ſhew our thankfulneſſe by obedience. If we once giue place to our enimy which dayly doth aſſault vs, I confeſſe (with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall) that we giue occaſion of our owne fall.

The Apoſtle commending his doctrine to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, ſayth: <hi>Vt ſapiens architectus, fundamentum poſui.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Corin. 3.</note> As a ſkilfull maſterbuilder, I haue layde the foundation: And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foundation can no man laye, than that which is layde, which is Chriſt Ieſus. Chriſt hath receyued of his father all things: he hath conferred vpon vs no leſſe: he by his death hath made entrance into life for vs: he is become our wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, our righteouſneſſe, our ſanctification and redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. By his name we muſt onely be ſaued: by hys doctrine we muſt only be directed: vpon that rock, that fayth of his, we muſt ſubſtantially be grounded. If any man teach other leſſons than of that, we muſt ſay with Paul, <hi>Si Angelus è celo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gallath.</note> If an Angel from heauen, teach otherwiſe than the Apoſtles haue preached to vs, let him be accurſed. And with S. Iohn, <hi>Quod audistis ab initio, id in vobis permaneat,</hi> Let that abide in you, which you haue heard from the beginning: ſo ſhal you
<pb facs="tcp:7817:28"/> continue both in the ſonne and in the father. And this is the promiſe that he hath promiſed vs,<note place="margin">1. Ioan.</note> euen eternall life. If any man do not bring this doctrine with him, do not ſo much as ſalute him,<note place="margin">Ioan. 14. Math. 15.</note> neyther receiue him into your houſes: For he that loueth God, heareth his voyce, ſayth Chriſt. And they in vayne do worſhip him, that teach the doctrine and preceptes of men.<note place="margin">Men in God his matters not to be beleued vvithout the vvord</note> Men haue their errors and imperfections, &amp; though they be the children of God, yet they be not guided by his good ſpirit alwayes. Euery man that hath an inſtrument in his hand, can not play on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame: nor euery man that hath learned the ſcience, can pleaſe the eare. But if the ſtrings be out of tune, or frets diſordered, there wanteth the harmony that ſhould delite: So whenſoeuer we ſwarue neuer ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, from the right trade of Gods holy word, we are not to be credited, we ought not to pleaſe. Wherefore ſith the way is daungerous, our féete ſlippery: that we fall oft, and are ſly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding euer: no maruell if the beſt of vs ſometime do halte. It falleth oft, that ſuch as preach &amp; profeſſe Chriſt, builde ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time on him, euill, vnſound, and corrupt doctrine. Not that the word of God is occaſion of hereſies, but that men lacke right vnderſtanding and iudgement of the ſame, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth only by the ſpirit of God. And this it is that S. Paule ſayth,<note place="margin">1.

Auguſtine ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when he would frame a perfecte preacher, willeth him to conferre the places of Scripture together. He ſendes him not to the Doctours diſtinctions, nor to the cenſure of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7817:28"/> Church, nor canons of the Popes, nor traditions of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but onely to quiet and content himſelfe with the word of God. Therfore in the primitiue Church, when as yet the new Teſtament was not written, al things were examined according to the ſermons and wordes of the Apoſtles. For which cauſe S. Iohn writeth: <hi>Qui ex Deo est, nos audit:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Ioan. 4.</note> He that is of of God, heareth vs: and he that heareth vs not, is not of God. So farre therfore as men accorde with the holy Scripture, and ſhape their writings after the paterne that Chriſt hath left them, I will not only my ſelf eſtéeme them, but wiſh them to be had in moſt renoune and reuerence. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, abſolutely to truſt to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which may be deceiued: &amp; gather out of the fathers writings, whatſoeuer was wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their imperfection, is neyther point of wiſdome, nor ſafety.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in his church: And yet in no age any was ſo perfect, that a certaine truth was to be builded on him.

Among the Iewes who was euer comparable vnto Aaron?<note place="margin">Aaron.</note> who fell ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully? he aſſented for feare vnto the peoples Idolatry.

I graunt the Scripture to be a good Iudge in deede: But vnleſſe the ſpirite of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and knoweledge, doe lighten our wyttes and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it ſhal auayle vs little or nothing, to haue at hand the worde of God, whereof we knowe not the ſenſe and meaning. Golde is tryed by the touchſtone, and metalles in the fier, yet onely of ſuche as are experte in the facultie. For neyther the touchſtone, nor yet the fier, can any thing further the ignoraunte and vnſkilfull. Wherefore, to be méete and conuenient men, to iudge of a truthe, when we
<pb facs="tcp:7817:30"/> do reade or heare it by the holy Ghoſt, we muſt be directed. In this behalfe, although I knowe that the giftes of God haue their degrées, yet dare I ſay, that none is vtterly ſo voide of grace,<note place="margin">It is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to trie a truthe.</note> but hath ſo much conferred on him, as ſhal be expedient for his owne behoofe, vnleſſe he be vtterly as a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten member cut of from Chriſt. Vaine it were to commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a thing that lies not in vs: and vs to deny the poſſibillitie, when we haue a promiſe of a thing that ſhall be, doth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue our inconſtancy and myſbelief. Wherefore ſyth Chriſt and his Apoſtles, ſaye often times, <hi>Videte, Cauete, Probate,</hi> which wordes be ſpoken in the commaunding mode: &amp; byd vs Sée, Beware, and Proue: I muſt néedes conclude, that we ſhal not be deſtitute of the ſpirit of God, ſo farre as ſhal be moſt néedefull for vs, if we doe aſke the ſame by fayth. And whereas Chriſt doth affirme that we ſhal knowe:<note place="margin">1. Ioan. 4.</note> And S. Iohn in his epiſtle, doth aſſure vs, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I aunſwere againe, that there be two kindes of examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of doctrine: one priuate, another publique. Priuate, wherby eche man doth ſettle his owne fayth, to ſtaye conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually vppon one doctrine, which he knoweth ſtedfaſtly, to haue procéeded from God. For conſciences ſhall neuer haue any ſure porte or refuge to runne vnto, but only God. He, when he is called vpon, will heare our prayers: when he is deſired, wil graunt vs his ſpirit.

But when we haue runne as farre as we can,<note place="margin">The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures laſte refuge.</note> we can goe no further than to the wall: we muſt reuolte to the former principles, and trye by the Scriptures, which is the Church.

In his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries vpon Paul, he ſayth: that Concupiſcence, vnleſſe it bring forth the externe worke, is no ſinne. Wherefore if he had ſayde ſo much for the Croſſe, as ye miſconſter, and more than accordeth with the glory of Chriſt, I might lappe it vp with other of his errours, and hauing the Scripture for me, Chriſoſtome ſhould be no preſident againſt me. But I will not goe this way to worke. I admit his authoritie, but marke, M. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, what his meaning is. In the place that ye alleage for the Croſſe, he dealt with the Gentiles. The marke that he ſhot at, was to proue to them, <hi>Quod Christus Deus eſset,</hi> that Chriſt was God, as in the title appeareth. Now bicauſe this puniſhment, to be hanged on the gallowes, was maruellous offenſiue vnto the heathen, nor they could thinke him to be a God, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> was executed with ſo vile a death: Chriſoſtome ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore goeth as far in the contrary, prouing, that that, which was a token of curſe, was now become the ſigne of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb facs="tcp:7817:32"/> And bycauſe that they ſpake ſo much ſhame of the Croſſe, derogating therfore from him that was crucified: the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to teſtifie by their outward facte, their inward profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, would make in euery place the ſigne therof. This was the occaſion that the myſticall Croſſe, crepte into cuſtome.

But to returne to the other purpoſe. If there be ſuch neceſſity of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſigne of the Croſſe to fight againſt Sathan, what a foole was Paule, when he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed a Chriſtian with his complete armour,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.</note> to forget this chiefe piece of defence, which is able (belike) to do more than all the reſt?<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7817:35"/> is plainly to be ſene by the word of god. That y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſigne of the Croſſe can do the like, I vtterly deny til you be at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to proue it. But why? doth not <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſay?<note place="margin">

He vſeth this propoſition: <hi>Omne peccatum est voluntarium.</hi> Euery ſinne is voluntarie: bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a common phraſe: yet he excludeth not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> byrth-ſinne, which is of neceſſity. The like could I ſpeake of other. Wherefore, not ſo much their ſaying, as their intente and meaning is to be conſidered. In this caſe, many of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſpeake of the Croſſe in the foreheade. The Scripture mencioneth the ſigne in the forehead. But to what purpoſe? Shal we think, that the breaking of the aire with a thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be, or drawing of a thing after ſuch a forme, is like to that which the Poets call <hi>Orci galea,</hi> the helmet of Hell: wherewithall, whoſoeuer be couered, they can not be ſéene, nor any ſhall hurt them? Then were the Croſſe worſe than the coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers Mace: then were the foreheade accurſed for hauing it.<note place="margin">The Croſſe in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heade vvhat it meaneth.</note> Wherefore there was a further meaning in it, which for your inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I wil now tel you. The forehead betokeneth ſhame. Whervpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prouerb, <hi>Perfricuit fronte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> he hath rubde his forehead, is ſpoken of him that is paſt ſhame. Wherfore the ſigne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of Chriſt, is willed to be ſet in the ſigne of ſhame, to ſignifie vnto vs, that of Chriſts death, we ſhuld not at any time be aſhamed.<note place="margin">Tom. <hi>8.</hi> in Pſal. <hi>141.</hi>
               </note> Nor this is my priuate expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Auguſtine confirmeth the ſame. <hi>Quia in fronte erubeſcitur ille qui dixit, Qui me erubuerit coram hominibus, erubeſcam eum co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram patre meo qui in Caelis est: ipſam ignominiam quodammodo, &amp; quam pagani derident, in loco pudoris nostri co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stituit. Audis homine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inſultare impudenti, &amp; dicere, fronte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> non habet. Quid est, fronte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> non
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7817:36"/> habet? Impudens est. Non habeam nud am frontem, tegat eam crux domini mei.</hi> Which is as much to ſay, as this. Bycauſe in the foreheade is that, whereby we are aſhamed of him that ſayde, He that ſhall be aſhamed of me before men, I wyll alſo be aſhamed of him before my father which is in Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the very ignominie and ſhame as it were, which the Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes doe laugh to ſcorne, he hath apointed in the place of our ſhame. Ye heare a man, lay to an impudent perſons charge, that he hath no foreheade, what is meant by that? He in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent. Let me not therefore haue a naked foreheade, let the Croſſe of my maſter Chriſt couer it. Thus may ye well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande the Fathers, whenſoeuer they teach you to make a Croſſe in your foreheade: for otherwiſe, the croſſing with out beleuing, is mere enchaunting.<note place="margin">Chriſoſto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               </hi> Thou muſt not with thy finger, ſimply printe the Croſſe in thy body, but fyrſt of al, with great fayth in thy minde. This is it, M. Martiall, that marres all your market.

But this is no mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall nor myſticall Croſſe, for neyther of them both, can be printed in the heart: Therefore it is the faith in Chriſts paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: which the finger cannot impreſſe in the forehead:<note place="margin">Folio. 18. b.</note> but grace can engraffe in the minde of man. <hi>Haec crux non terribi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, ſed despicabiles hominibus daemones effecit.</hi> This Croſſe hath made Diuels, not terrible, but contemptible vnto men.<note place="margin">M.

<pb facs="tcp:7817:37"/> For the ſenſe can not ſtand with it. Nowe where ye gather (but indirectly) out of Chriſoſtoms words, that two things be requiſite: firſt printing the merits of Chriſtes paſſion in the minde, afterward the ſigning of the Croſſe in the body: I briefly aunſwere. <hi>Frustra fit per plura, quod fieri potest per pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciora.</hi> In vayne it is to doe by the moe, that may be done by the fewer.

When they prayſe a thing, they aſcribe more vnto it than they meane, and many times vnder the name of one thing, applyed fitly to our capacities, they vnderſtande another.

               </hi> Wherevpon I ſhall haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion hereafter to entreate, when I come to ſpeake of the like abſurditie,<note place="margin">Folio. 19. b.</note> the little pieces of the Croſſe kept. Now let vs heare what ye finde in other. <hi>Origen</hi>
               <note place="margin">Origen.</note> ye bring, in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Epiſtle to the Romanes. <hi>Lib. 6.</hi> And although this father maketh moſt agaynſt you, as afterward ſhal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, yet to the ende that ſuch yong ſchollers as you, may
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7817:37"/> learne with what iudgement ye ought to reade the olde wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I thinke it expedient, ſomewhat to ſpeake of him. In ſundry poynts his doctrine is ſounde: ſpecially concerning the Trinitie, the two natures in Chriſt, the baptiſme of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, original ſinne, and vſe of Images. But things haue paſſed vnder his name, where are intermedled many fonde opinions, which both were condemned in his own time, and are not now to be credited of vs. As, that before the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the worlde, there was an other worlde. That the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels in hell, ſhall at the laſt be ſaued. And if ye ſcan his other writings, there will appeare, eyther great inconſtancie, or very ſmall perfection. In the article of iuſtification he ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth from himſelfe, and in ſome poyntes from all other too. The ſpirite he taketh, not for the motion of the holy Ehoſte but for the Allegoricall interpretation. Peter, he ſuppoſeth to excell the reſt, bycauſe it was ſayde to him in the plurall number. Whatſoeuer thou loſeſt in earth ſhall be loſed in the Heauens.<note place="margin">Caelis &amp; Caelo.</note> Whereas to other it is ſpoken in the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar number, It ſhall be loſed in Heauen. Theſe and ſuch other toyes, are not onely in him, but alſo in other of hys time and age: wherefore they ought to be redde as witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of things done, not as Preſidents of fayth and doctrine. Yet, vnleſſe you, M. Martiall, will ſet <hi>Origen</hi> to ſchole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, and teach him what to ſay: you can not conſter any leſſon of his, to picke out a proufe of any other Croſſe, than the minde conceyueth, not the hand maketh. For though ye bring a piece of a ſentence, wherein the prayſe of the Croſſe is put, <hi>Tanta vis est Crucis,</hi> So great is the power of the Croſſe, (ꝙ he) Yet if ye remembred the very nexte wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that goe before, ye ſhould playnly ſée of what Croſſe he meant.

Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more we haue Images and worthy offerings vnto God, not ſuch as be made by vncleane workemen, but framed and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned by Gods word in vs: wherby ſuch vertues may reſt in vs, which ſhall imitate and reſemble the firſt begotten of all creatures: in whome examples are, as well of Iuſtice, continence, and valiantneſſe: as otherwiſe of wiſdome, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and all vertues. Therefore ſuch Images are in al, as haue by the word of God, gotten them, this temperance, this righteouſneſſe, this fortitude, this wiſedome and piety, with all the frame of other vertues, in which I thinke it méete, the honor be giuen vnto him, which is the paterne of all Images, the Image of God inuiſible, &amp; ſo forth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeareth (as in playne wordes he ſpeaketh after) that all Images ſhould be ſuch, as God himſelfe commaunded: ſuch as ſhould be within man, and not without man: ſuch as conſiſted in the knoweledge of him, after whoſe Image man himſelf was made.

The like may be ſayd of Auſtins place,<note place="margin">Auguſtin</note> for where he ſpeaketh of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7817:40"/> the articles of our fayth, called in latine <hi>Symbolum,</hi>

               </hi> and enſigne of the Croſſe. What meaneth he by that Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phore? What is that enſigne of the Croſſe? The Banner that is caried about the churchyard in proceſſion? No: But that which in the ſelfe ſame ſentence before he called <hi>Canticu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſalutis,</hi> ioyning it with <hi>Symboli remedio, contra antiqui Serpentis venenum,</hi> The ſong of ſaluation, ioyned with the remedie of the .xij.

            <p>Ye ſée by this time that your authorities make nothing for you: The wrong vnderſtanding of the name <hi>(Croſſe)</hi> doth make your arguments runne of vncertayne féete, and halte downe right. The ioyntely concurring of fayth, and fruites I know to be neceſſary: the word of God doth teach me: But the neceſſary concurrence of the ſigne of the Croſſe with fayth, is more than you can learne, eyther of Gods worde, or elſe good father, and therfore more than we ought to beleue, vnleſſe we wilfully beleue a lye.<note place="margin">Mat. 16.

The Apoſtles that gloried in the Croſſe, that is to ſay, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of Chriſt, that liued vnder the Croſſe: that is to ſay, were ſubiect to afflictions, carying about with them the death of Chriſt in their mortall bodies: that did many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles

I thinke in déede that the Croſſe quarrellers toke all their preſident of <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtata,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Papiſtes take Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of Iulian the Apoſtata Folio. 21. a.</note> that whereas they meante to haue as little Religion, they would haue as light a reſcue, as he had. But before I come, to recitall of his ſtory: let me cite your compariſon. It is not odious, but to ridiculous, The bare ſigne of the Croſſe, ye prefer before naked, ſole and only fayth. The ſigne of the Croſſe, of it ſelf what is it? A beating of the ayre: a throwing of a ſtone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the winde: in effect nothing. But fayth, make it as naked and bare as you can, yet is it a qualitie of the minde, which at the leaſt wiſe to the worlde commends vs. For let it be as the ſcholemen terme it, <hi>fides informis,</hi> an vnſhapen fayth:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.</note> or as Paul calleth it <hi>fides ficta,</hi> a fayned fayth: or the worſt that ye can make it, <hi>Daemonum fides,</hi> the Diuels fayth: Yet doth it teach vs ſomewhat, it taketh away the excuſe of ignoraunce, as Paule to the Romanes witneſſeth. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth a ſinne vpon vs, as Chriſt himſelfe affirmeth. If I had not come &amp; ſpoken to them,<note place="margin">Ioan. 15.</note> they ſhould haue no ſinne. Your naked Croſſe, as it can not ſtande by it ſelfe, ſo in it ſelfe it contayneth nothing, vnleſſe perhaps ſome wormes and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders be crept into a corner of it. All muſt reſt in the conceyt of man and his imagination. I might ſay with <hi>Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas: <hi>Quod fides informis &amp; formata fides est idem habitus, quia ad naturam fidei nihil attinet ſiue charitas ad fit, ſiue non adſit. Nam hoc per accidens ſit:</hi>
               </hi> as he ſayth. Whoſe wordes in engliſh be theſe: Fayth vnſhaped and ſhaped fayth, is all one conſtant qualitie, bycauſe it ſkilleth not for the nature of fayth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charitie be there or no. For that is an accidentall thing.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7817:41"/> Now if this were true: a naked fayth, were far better than a naked Croſſe: bycauſe there ſhould be no difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene a naked fayth, and a fayth cladde, as well as can be. But if I ſhould ſtand in defence of this, I ſhould be as fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceiued as your Sainct was.<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>3.</hi> Sent. Dist <hi>23.</hi> Cap. Vnicu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> I wil reaſon with you out of the maſter of the Sentence. Let fayth be taken <hi>Sine pro eo quo creditur, ſiue pro eo quod creditur,</hi> eyther for that wherby we beleue, or elſe for that which is beleued: certayne it is, that the ſimpleſt of them both, is better than a ſigne, though it be of the Croſſe. For be it the latter fayth, <hi>Quam Daemones et falſi Christiani habent,</hi> as he ſaith: which the Diuels &amp; falſe chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians haue, yet by the ſame, <hi>Poſsunt credere deum, et credere deo.</hi> they can beleue that there is a God, they can giue credit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his words. But a bare Croſſe can not do this. Take me a man that neuer hearde of Chriſt, and bring him to a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyard to beholde all his Croſſes, at the Mary Maſſe, and he ſhall be as learned when he commeth away, as the Ape is deuout, when he hath eaten the hoſte. But if a man neyther did, nor could euer heare at all, this naked fayth were able to teach him, without any further information, that a God there is, which the very Gentiles did vnderſtande. Agayne to compare a gifte of God, which is in the minde, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> work of man made with the hande, is <hi>Canibus catulos coniungere, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribus haedos.</hi> To ioyne the whelpes and houndes, the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and goates together. Nowe to your <hi>Iulian.</hi>

Then the Diuels loking backe, and ſeing the figure of the Lordes banner, and remembring their fall and ouerthrovv, ſodaynly vanished out of ſight.</hi> Thus much, or ſo much as this ye cite out of <hi>Theodorete,</hi> and <hi>Gregory Nazianzene.</hi> For the truth of the hiſtorie I contende not with you. But what I iudge of the experiment I will tell you. Fyrſt of al,
<pb facs="tcp:7817:42"/> that wicked, reprobate, and godleſſe perſones, can vſe the ſigne of the Croſſe as well as other. Which propoſition ſhal quite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute all your ninth Article. For if ſuch as <hi>Iulian</hi> can croſſe themſelues: and notwithſtanding haue neuer a whit the more fayth, (as your ſelfe confeſſe) then how falles it out <hi>that the Croſſe driueth out hereſies.</hi>

Fol. 114. 115. that the ſigne of the Croſſe maketh vvicked men to think vpon God, that the Croſſe is comfortable in deſperation. Fol. 116.</hi> Secondly, this I note. How ſore the Diuel was hurt by the Croſſe, when it nothwithſtanding, he retayned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poſſeſſion of whole <hi>Iulian</hi> both in body and ſoule. Thyrdly, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell doth fayne himſelf to be afrayde of that, which with all his heart he would haue men to vſe. For this is a generall rule, that the Diuell is a lier, and alwayes will ſéeme to be as he is not. If there were no other matter in the worlde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt you, this onely were ſufficient to diſcredite you. For what better reaſon is there, that Croſſing ought not to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at al, than that the Diuel did ſéeme to dread it. If that in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dede he had bene afrayd of it, he would haue doubled a point with you: and not haue played ſo open play. He runs from the Stéeple to dwell in the people. He counterfets a flight from the holy water bucket, and neſtles himſelfe in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the prieſt. He ſéemeth to giue place to the charmers inchantment, &amp; yet that ſacrifice doth pleaſe him excedingly. Ye confeſſe, that <hi>Iulian</hi> had no hope in Chriſt, no loue to god, no faith: and will ye not confeſſe, that he was therby a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſon, &amp; a lyin of the Diuell? The Diuell, then, ſhuld haue done him wrong, if he had put him in any further dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. But one thing I maruell at: how you, M. Martiall, a bacheler of law: ſometime Vſher of Wincheſter: now ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in Diuinitie: making a boke: intitled to the Quéene: peruſed by the Learned: priuiledged by the King: allowed by Cunner: ſhould fall into manifeſt contradictions, &amp; ſcape

               <hi>The ſigne of the Croſſe muſt concurre vvith fayth, and fayth vvith the ſigne of the Croſſe.</hi> Nowe, ye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the bare ſigne of the Croſſe without any fayth, to haue the force and power aforeſayd. If I thought ye were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Sathans practiſes, I would ſhew you ſome of them, to make you more circumſpect. But you haue bene brought vp in his ſchole a good while, and therefore I thinke ye prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe after him, endeuouring your ſelfe, of ſet purpoſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. For which, like a Spider ye ſpinne a ſubtile webbe. You ſucke out of the Fathers the worſt ioyce that you can, that you may turne the ſame into your owne fylthy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected nature. <hi>Gregorie</hi> did well in abhorring the name of vniuerſall Byſhop.

But the preſident of that, perſuadeth you not.

               </note> As that for confirmation of ſacrifice for the dead, he bringeth forth a viſion, a dreame, or a dotage, ſuch a one as I am aſhamed to father vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him,
<pb facs="tcp:7817:43"/> or any one of the faythfull: yet proufe good inough for ſuch a matter of naught. His tale, is this. A certayne prieſt that vſed the bathes, went on a day into them, and found a yong man (whome he knewe not) very obſequious and ſeruiſeable vnto him, he pulled of his ſhooes, he toke his garmentes, he did whatſoeuer might be comfortable for him. When this he had often done, one day the prieſte going thitherwarde thought thus with himſelfe: I ought not to ſéeme vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto him, which hath ſo deuoutly bene accuſtomed to ſerue me, whenſoeuer I waſhe me, but néedes I muſt cary him ſomewhat for a reward. Then toke he with him the tops of two loaues which had ben offered at ſeruice. And as ſone as euer he came vnto the place, he founde his man, he vſed his ſeruiſe as he was wont in all poynts. Thus when he had waſhed and put on his clothes, as he was going out, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered (as a bleſſing) vnto the man that had bene ſo diligent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, that which he brought with him, requiring him curteouſly to accepte that which he offred him, in the way of charitie. But he mourning and afflicted, anſwered: Father, what meaneſt thou to giue me theſe? This breade is holy, this can I not eate. For I whome thou ſéeſt, ſometime was Lord of this place. But for my ſinnes nowe after my death am deputed hither. But if thou wilt doe any thing for me, offer this bread vnto almighty God for me, to be a mediator for my ſinnes. And then know that god hath hard thy praier, when thou ſhalt come hither to bathe thée &amp; finde me not. So the next weke after, the prieſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued in mourning for him, euery day did offer the hoſt for him, and afterward when he came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bath, he found him not. Herevpon father Gregory concludeth. <hi>Qua ex re quantum proſit animabus immolatio ſacrae ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationis ostenditur, quando hanc &amp; ipſi mortuorum ſpiritus à viuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus petunt, &amp; ſigna indicant quibus per eam abſoluti videantur.</hi> In engliſh this. By which thing it is ſhewed how much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the holy oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> profiteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoules, when the ſpirites
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7817:43"/> of the deade require this of the liuing, &amp; ſhew ſignes wherby they may appeare to be deliuered by it. And ſo far Gregory. But is it not a pitiful caſe, that of ſo weak a grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, ſo wicked a doctrine ſhould be builded, contrary to the manifeſt worde of God? In the .xviij. of Deuteronomie: Seke not to learne a truth of the deade. And in the .viij. of the Prophete Eſay. Should not a people inquire at their God? ſhal they depart from the liuing to the dead? Howe ſoeuer the ſtate of men is after this life, no doctrine ſhould be gathered of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> talking of ſpirites. And furthermore, that dead men do ſerue in the bathes vpon the earth: be loſed out of the popiſh Purgatorie which they affirme to be <hi>ſubtus terram,</hi> vnder the earth, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as it were Barbers apprentices vpon the earth, may well be a legend for <hi>Plato</hi> his Purgatorie, ioyned with the tale of <hi>Danaus</hi> daughters, who poure in water into a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe tubbe. Wherefore, M. Martiall, doubt ye not this, but the wicked ſpirits, which ſaw <hi>vas vacuum ſed ſignatum,</hi> an empty veſſell but ſigned with the Croſſe, were bolde not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, <hi>ad euitandum vacuum,</hi> to enter into him. As for the words of <hi>Lactantius,</hi> which you bring forth,<note place="margin">

For by the ſigned foreheade they ſignified baptiſme, and the fayth of Chriſt which they profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Otherwiſe if it be as you ſay,<note place="margin">Folio. 23.</note> 
               <hi>that ſpirits can not abyde the ſigne of the Croſſe, nor continue in place vvhere any man is that hath the ſigne of the Croſſe.</hi> the beſte counſell that I can giue men, is to be marked, to burne their fleſhe with an hote yron, and make a durable Croſſe in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heades, whereby they may be frée, as long as they liue, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fearing of ſpirits, without any more a do. But I feare me
<pb facs="tcp:7817:44"/> leaſt this be no ſufficient defence. For <hi>Serapis</hi> &amp; his prieſts were all to be Croſſed: and yet the Diuels daunced among them. The Pope hath his Croſſes, yea double and treble, yet is not the Diuell afrayde to come at him. <hi>Silueſter</hi> the .ij. as <hi>Platina</hi> reporteth, was a practiſer of naughty artes, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in addict himſelfe altogether vnto the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon enimy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. And in dede firſt he gat the Archbyſhoprike of <hi>Reme,</hi> and afterward of <hi>Rauenna,</hi> by Symony. Laſt of all, by the Diuels forwarding help, he gat alſo the occupying of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes ſée: howbeit, vnder this condition, that when he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this life, he ſhuld be al wholly the Diuels, by whoſe falſe deceyts he obtayned ſo high dignity. Whervpon as theſame <hi>Platina,</hi> the Popes owne Secretarie doth write. When <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſter</hi> was not circumſpect inough, in being ware of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels baytes, he was killed, all to pulled, of the promoter of his, the Diuel: Yea, when he was a Maſſing in the Church. A ſtrange caſe, M.

Now I beſech you turn ouer your hiſtories, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſult with your elders, &amp; ſée what it was that brought the Gentiles to chriſtianite, the Idolatrous nations to true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               <hi>made of ſome earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matter to be ſet vp in Churches, or made vvith mannes hand in the ayre, in form &amp; likeneſſe of the other,</hi> then is it ſomwhat that you haue ſayd. But if it were the preaching of the word (as moſt certain it is) which did ſo work in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of men, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> refuſing their errors, they became to be fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: then you, are a falſefier of the word, M. Martial. Learne you of me, that preaching is that hand of God, that ſtandard of his, whereby that merciful effect is wrought, as wel in vs as in al other, to be brought to the truth from blindneſſe &amp; ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. And if ye thinke ſcorne to learne of me, learne of God himſelfe, who in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> text before, ſayth: that his mouth is a ſharp ſweard, and that preaching is a choſen ſhaft, had in the quiuer of the almighty. For the word in operation is as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible as a ſweard: it moueth, it rauiſheth, it renueth men: it pearceth to the heart, it ſearcheth the ſecret places, it entreth through, as S. Paul ſayth,<note place="margin">Heb. 4,</note> euen vnto the deuiding aſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of the ſoule and of the ſpirits, &amp; of the ioynts, &amp; of the marowe:
<pb facs="tcp:7817:45"/> and is a diſcerner of the thoughtes, and the intentes of the heart: neyther is there any creature which is not manifeſte in his ſight, but al things are naked and open vnto his eyes, with whome we haue to do. This two edged ſweard which God hath put in the mouth of man, doth trye the force of things ſet againſt it. It cutteth the corrupt affections from the heart. It openeth the feſtered ſores, the peſtilent impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumes of our ill deſires. It ouerthroweth the kingdome of Sathan, It ſlayes his hoſt, ſinne, death and hell. And as an arrowe which is paſt the bowe of a cunning archer, can not be ſtayed by hand, before it haue his lighting place: ſo doth the word hold ſtil his conſtant courſe: it maketh way wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it goeth: it falleth as he willeth, which is the onely directer of it. But fall where it will, it falleth with effect, nor any man can withſtand the blowe that it giueth.

No doubt but it ſhalbe the enſigne of the Croſſe, that it may be fulfilled which is written, The earth is ful of his prayſes. Here Hierome doth explicate himſelf, what he doth meane by the enſigne of the Croſſe: the ſetting forth of the prayſe of God, which is not by ſetting of a Croſſe on the altar, but by preaching the crucified Chriſt vnto people.

Wherefore by an <hi>Ironye,</hi> he ſayth vnto them. Blowe the trumpet in the land: crie and gather together and ſay: Aſſemble your ſelues, and let vs go into ſtrong cities. Set vp the ſtandard in Sion. &amp;c. As if that he had ſayde. I knowe what you will doe: when the wrath of God ſhall fall vpon you, when your ennimies ſhall oppreſſe you, you will not conſider the cauſe thereof: but you wil run to your ſtrong holdes, you wil arme your ſelues, and ſtand at your defence: you wil ſet vp your ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard in Sion, and thinke that you ſhall be ſafe there.

And truely there is no cauſe why Hierome in this place, ſhould runne to his Allegorie, whereas there is ſo playne and ſound a ſenſe in the letter.

Nor onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente with his owne cenſure, he bringeth after a proufe of Scripture, that the wordes cannot be ſpoken of the Croſſe, but of the body of Chriſt himſelfe: bicauſe the reſt of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſtes writing of the ſame matter, doe only ſay: <hi>Vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt filium hominis venientem.</hi> They ſhall ſée the ſonne of man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming.

So that ye challenge more a great deale, than we nede to grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t you. But you ſhal ſée howe curteouſly I wil deale with you. Admit that the ſigne of the ſonne of man, is the Croſſe in déede? What haue ye gayned nowe? Firſte, it ſhall be no materiall Croſſe made with mannes hande, nor yet a ſigne prynted in his foreheade. Therefore ye muſt runne to a fyfte ſignification of Croſſe in Scripture: for this can not ſerue for the fourth. The places that ye cite out of the ninth of Ezechiell, and ſeauenth of the Reuelation, where many be ſealed into Gods ſeruauntes, (out of which order I feare
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7817:46"/> me leaſt a number of my Croſſemaſters, may cry with the Fryer, <hi>Nos ſumus exempti,</hi> we are exempt) I maruel that you can without bluſhing vtter. But if ye haue any ſhame in you, I will make you to bluſhe. Thinke you that the ſigne of <hi>GOD</hi> in the foreheades, was the ſigne of a Croſſe drawen with a finger? Is the ſpirit of life and liuely fayth, (which only expreſſe the true printe of God) inſpired, as ſone as a Croſſe is figured? Is the ſigne of a Croſſe ſufficient to diſcerne the good from the bad? the faythfull from the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels? Yet ſuch muſt the ſigne of the Croſſe be, if it be the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame, that eyther Ezechiel or Sainct Iohn ſpeaketh of. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this ye groſſe Papiſte, that he that marked the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heades in Ezechiell, was neyther Caruer, Croſſer, nor Coniurer. He was clothed in linnen, and had an ynkehorne by his ſide. He bare the type of a Scribe and a Prieſt. The marke that he gaue them, was the letter <hi>Thau</hi>
               <note place="margin">The let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Thau.</note> (of which I ſpeake more in the next Article) ſignifying the law, directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or rule. To note, that the miniſter of Gods word, muſt printe the ſeale. He muſte ingraue in the very hearte, the lawe of God, and rule of fayth: and then be they ſafe and ſure from all euill. The bloude of the Lambe in the olde lawe, was not caſte behinde the dore, but ſprinckeled vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the dore poſtes: The marke of God is not ſet in the backe, but in the foreheade of all the faythfull: That, as thinges moſt manifeſt, be ſayde to be written in a mannes foreheade, and the forehead is the place of ſhame: ſo ſhould the ſeruantes of the lyuing God, lightened wyth his worde and holy ſpirite, neuer diſſemble it, or be aſhamed of it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, the perſons ſealed, as well in Ezechiell, as in the Reuelation, doe ſhewe that they had a ſurer marke, than a ſory ſigne of the Croſſe can be. For in Ezechiell we reade. Paſſe thorowe the Citie of Hieruſalem, and ſette a marke vpon the foreheades of them that mourne and cry, for all the abhominations that be done in the myddeſte thereof.
<pb facs="tcp:7817:47"/> And in the ſeauenth of the Reuelation: Tyll we haue ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſeruaunts of our God in their foreheads. Therefore ſuch as lamente and be ſory for abhominable wickedneſſe, ſuch as be in dede the ſeruants of God, they be ſealed: But all men indifferentely haue the ſigne of the Croſſe, many moe than be grieued with the ſight of ſinne, or doe continue in the feare of God: Therefore the ſeale, that in theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is ſpoken of, is not the ſigne of the Croſſe. <hi>Iulian</hi> was Croſſed, Pope <hi>Silueſter</hi> was croſſed, and yet, as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued afore, neyther of them both did mourne for their ſinnes, or ſerued God.

But the paſſion of Chriſt, and maner of his death was onely prefigured. What is this, to the ſigne? And if it were ſo (which you ſhall neuer proue) that the ſigne it ſelfe: the God of the Roode lofte: the Croſſe of the altare were prefigured, what is that to your purpoſe?

               <hi>Let the lifting vp of my handes be as an euening ſacrifice.</hi> The heauy hands, whereof the ſtory ſpeaketh, do ſignify the ſluggiſhneſſe and fainting of our fleſh, in al ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and honeſte exerciſe. But as Moſes faynting had a ſtone put vnder him, ſo we muſt haue Chriſt that ſpirituall ſtone, to ſupport our weakeneſſe: as Aaron and Hur ſtayed vp Moſes handes, ſo the miniſters of the worde, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the hearts,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> of them, that make their prayers, with the mercyfull promiſes of almighty God. But Auguſtine ſayth <hi>that beſide al this, the figure of the Croſſe vvas foreshevved there.</hi> That am I well contented to admit. But your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhing of the text, I will not admit. For where as the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine hath <hi>Manibus in Crucis figuram extenſis,</hi> you to expound it thus, <hi>his handes helde vp a Croſſe:</hi> is to abſurd and fooliſh. For to ſtretch out his handes in forme of a Croſſe: and to holde his handes a Croſſe, is two thinges. The ſtretching forth is at the armes ende, as Chriſtes was on the Croſſe, with the whole diſtance of body betwixt them. The holding of the hands a Croſſe, is with one, ouer the other. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by your reaſon, Moſes made a Croſſe, but it was a Sainct Andrewes Croſſe. Or if you will haue the figure of the Church Croſſe repreſented here, then Moſes put one of his handes vnder his other elbowe, which the texte beareth not. But O blindeneſſe of Poperie, that neyther vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the fathers writing, nor can giue a reaſon of your owne ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. Moſes ſtretching out his handes, made a figure of the Croſſe. But your learning can not reach to knowe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7817:50"/> what the olde figure of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Croſſe was. It is like to the Greke Υ which oure countreyman and late Cardinall M. Poole vnderſtode well ynough. And therefore in his newe gallery at Lambheth, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glaſſe windowes, he drew this figure Υ, in token of the Croſſe, as is yet to be ſéene. But what is this figure like to the Roode or Crucifixe? What haue ye gayned by this allegation, but vtterly bewrayed your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce? And certaynely if Goddes worde woulde ſuffer vs (which in dede is agaynſt it) to haue and occupy the ſigne of a Croſſe, yet the forme that we vſe, is agaynſt all preſident of Scripture and antiquitie. Which, when I come anone to the expoſition of the letter <hi>Thau,</hi> ſhall appeare more playnly.<note place="margin">Folio. 28. b.</note> But your freſh argument inferred of the place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, moueth me to laughter with an indignation. For it ſauoures nothing of the ſchoole, ſaue that it hath, <hi>Ergo,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the concluſion, which euery alewife can doe as well as you. It hath neyther mode nor figure, witte, nor common ſenſe. For this is your reaſon. <hi>The Diuell is diſcomfited by ihe Croſſe of our Lord, vvhich vvas prefigured by the handes of Moſes: But by Moſes handes the ſigne of the Croſſe vvas prefigured, Ergo by the ſigne of the Croſſe Diuels are ouercommed.</hi> I néede not to ſhewe the errour of your argument, for it is to manifeſte, and hath nothing elſe but errour in it. If thus ye had ſayde, <hi>Diuels are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited by that vvhich Moſes handes prefigured, But Moſes handes prefigured the ſigne of the Croſſe, Ergo by the ſigne of the Croſſe, Diuels are diſcomfited,</hi> I would haue better allowed your argument, &amp; denied your <hi>Minor,</hi> which is the ſecond propoſition: for Moſes hands prefigured not the ſigne of the Croſſe, but the Croſſe it ſelf, which is the death of Chriſt. Loke on the words of your author. But one fault is to familiar with you, that what ſoeuer is ſpoken of effect of the paſſion, you doe attribute to the inſtrumente and ſigne. So the woode of <hi>Marah,</hi> prefigured the glory and
<pb facs="tcp:7817:51"/> grace of the Croſſe: not of the ſigne, but of the thing it ſelf. For the bitterneſſe of death is not taken away, by a materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Croſſe or ſigne in the foreheade, but death by death is ſwallowed.<note place="margin">1.

But that the Latine <hi>T</hi> or Gréeke <hi>Tau,</hi> and Hebrewe <hi>Thau,</hi> be all alike, none wil ſay, but ſuch a great cleark as you. For in dede as the Hebrewe letter is different in faſhion from the Gréeke, ſo in ſignification they were quite contrary. The Hebrewes by their ת <hi>Thau</hi> did figure death, the Gréekes by their <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

When the Vandales had ſpoyled Italie, and caried from thence many captiues into Africk with them, <hi>Paulinus</hi> a godly man, and Byſhoppe in thoſe parties, gaue the pore ſoules whatſoeuer he had, for their reliefe. And when he could extende his charity no further, but al was gone: a wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe on a day came to him, lamenting hir eſtate, that hir ſonne was caried away priſoner, and by the kings ſonne in lawe: wherfore ſhe beſought him, to giue hir ſomewhat for his raunſome, if happely his Lord and taker would accept it. But the good man deuiſing with him ſelfe what he might gyue for hir comfort: founde nothing but his owne perſon, and therefore he ſaide, good wife, I haue nothing for thée, ſaue onely my ſelfe: Take me: ſay I am thy ſeruaunt, and giue me vp for a bondman in thy ſonnes ſtéede. The woman hearing this of ſo great a perſonage, thought rather that he mockt hir, then pitied hir. But he perſwaded hir to do after his aduiſe, forward they went, the wydowe as the miſteris, the Byſhop as the bond man. To Affrick they came: They mette wiih the kings ſonne in law: The wydow makes hir humble ſute, to haue hir ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne reſtored to hir. But he doth not onely refuſe to aſſent, but diſdaine to here ſuch a caytiffe as ſhe was. At length ſhe beſought him, ſo much to tender hir, as to accept for her ſonnes exchaunge, a ſeruaunt that ſhe had brought him, preſenting the byſhop. When the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had beheld his ſwéete face and fatherly countenaunce, he aſked him of what occupation he was No occupation, ꝙ he, but I can kepe your garden wel: whervpon he was wel contented to accept the ſeruaunt, and the onely ſonne was giuen vp vnto the mother. Thus was the pityfull wydowe gladded. The reuerende Father became a gardiner. Nowe
<pb facs="tcp:7817:57"/> when the kings ſonne in lawe ſhoulde vſe to reſort into hys garden, he queſtioned often with him, and finding him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye prudent in his aunſweres, forſooke the company of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers his familiers, and rather choſe to talke with his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner. <hi>Paulinus</hi> then, accuſtomed euery day to bring ſallads to his Lordes table, and hauing hys dinner with him, go to his worke againe. When thus he had continued a certaine ſeaſon, it fell out on a day, that as his Maiſter was in ſecret talke with him, he ſaide on this ſort: Sée what ye doe, make good prouiſion, how the kingdome of the <hi>Vandales,</hi> may be diſpoſed and gouerned. For the King (ſooner than ye are ware, and very ſhortly) ſhall dye. When this he heard, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was beloued of the king more than the reſt, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celed it not, but vttered all that he vnderſtoode by his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner, whom he reputed to be very wyſe. When the king heard it, he aunſwered. I would fayne ſée the man that you talke of. Then ſaide hys ſonne in lawe, <hi>Paulinus</hi> Maiſter: He vſeth to prepare mée, ſallades for my dynner, and to the ende ye may know him, I will take order, that hée ſhal bring them vnto the table, where your highneſſe ſhall ſitte. And euen ſo he did: whom as ſone, as euer the king had eſpyed he began to tremble, and calling aſide his ſonne in law, reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hys ſecret vnto him, ſaying: True it is, that thou haſte heard. For this night in my dreame, I ſaw certaine iudges ſitting in the place of iudgement againſt mée, among whom, this man was alſo one: and they awarded the ſcourge from me, which I ſometime tooke in hande againſte other. But aſke what he is, for I think him not to be any common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as he ſemeth, but rather a man of great worthineſſe and eſtimation. Then ſecretely, the kings ſonne in lawe did call <hi>Paulinus</hi> to him, and enquired earneſtly what he was. To whom the good man aunſwered: I am thy ſeruaunt, whome thou diddeſt take a ſubſtitute, for the wydowes ſonne. But when more inſtantly he lay vpon him, to vtter, not who he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7817:57"/> nowe was, but what condition and eſtate he was of, in his owne countrey: at length with much a do, he confeſſed that he was a Byſhop. When his maſter and Lord heard it, he was ſtricken in a great feare: and aſke (ꝙ he) what ſoeuer thou wilt, that thou mayſt retourne into thine owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, bountifully rewarded of me.

Which thing was accompliſhed: and the captiues ſought throughout all the countrey, were ſente home agayne, and ſhips full of grayne with them. Thus God for deliuery of his ſeruants, vſed the miniſtery of a captiue Byſhop: And ſhall we gather of this, that in like extremities, we muſte haue a byſhop to become a gardiner, and with ſallets in hys hande, wayte at his maſters table? Yet as good reaſon for this, as for the vſe of the Croſſe, grounded on Conſtantines apparition. A wiſe man, of this and ſuch lyke examples, would haue gathered an other maner of rule generall, and ſayd: that by this we learne, how God neuer forſaketh his, but by ſecret meanes vnknowen to the world, worketh their comforte and deliuery.

For the glittering ſigne of the Croſſe in the element, the croſſing of the Iewes coates when they would haue reedified their Hieruſalem, was but a token of Gods wrath and vengeaunce: and although it was <hi>Signum ſalutaris Crucis,</hi> the ſigne of the healthfull Croſſe: yet was it not healthfull to them that ware it: but rather a teſtimonie of Gods iuſt iudgement agaynſt them. Wherfore, as God miraculouſly did worke, and vſed this ſigne to contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes: ſometime for comforte, ſometime to diſpeire: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time for the godly, ſometime to the wicked: So muſte we not, contrary to reaſon, gather an vniuerſall, onely of the one ſide: and contrary to his will, abuſe it at our pleaſure.

Nowe by your owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, where the wicked onely be ſigned with the Croſſe, where the Croſſe doth worke nothing but confuſion: the groundwork of your cauſe is miſerably ſhaken, and you be turned ouer in your owne trip. Of all your examples, ye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre your owne fanſy: what you do thinke Gods meaning was, to ſhew ſuch ſignes of the Croſſe, both vnder the law, and in the time of grace: but of your meaning ye bring no proufe at all, eyther out of Scripture or Doctours, that ye bragge of.

<pb facs="tcp:7817:65"/> Idoll, to make an other, (as in the firſt article I proued) nor to adore it, was in any wyſe tollerable, as afterwarde more at large appeareth. Wherfore your reaſon, being (as it is) abſurde and fooliſhe, we be not driuen to any ſuch ſhifte, as ye talke of, to ſay that fayth ſhould be fixt in a wall. Wée know no ſuch melodie, to moue as you ſay, harde ſtones, or make braſen pillers to vnderſtande: though your magicall minſtrelſie hath bene ſuch, that rotten ſtockes haue ſpoke at your pleaſure, ſpoken good reaſon (as you haue eſtemed it.) Remember ye not the Roode of Wincheſter, that cunningly deciſed a controuerſie, betwéene the Monkes and maryed prieſtes, pronouncing in latine (for he was better taught then hys maſters the Monkes,) <hi>Non bene ſentiunt qui fauent presbyteris.</hi> They thinke not well that fauour the prieſtes?

               <hi>Diuell,</hi> or both? It hath bene alwayes a Popiſhe practiſe, to make Roodes &amp; Images to rolle their eyes, to ſweate, and to ſpeake, (wherof infinite examples might be brought.) But that of men, profeſſing the Goſpell, of proteſtants (as ye call them) there hath bene any ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, is not in any writing of any age to be founde. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye doe vs wrong, in burdening vs with ſuch vntruthes, vnleſſe by remembrance of your owne follyes, ye will force vs (as it were) to open and diſcloſe your ſhame. But let mee come to your counſels. The firſt ye fetch from the recorde of <hi>Iuo,</hi> &amp; <hi>Gratian,</hi> alleaging a Synode kept at <hi>Orleance</hi> in Fraunce. Ye doe right well to cite your authors: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I might haue ſuſpected the authoritie. For in all the Canons of the councell it ſelfe, we reade not the words that make for your purpoſe. But you do wyſely, not to paſſe the compaſſe of your owne profeſſion, and therfore ſay no more than the popiſhe decrées do teache you. But if a man may be ſo bolde in your owne faculty to appoſe you: how doe the woords of this your counſell proue, that euery Church muſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7817:65"/> haue the ſigne of the Croſſe?<note place="margin">Folio. 40.</note> 
               <hi>Forſoth</hi> (ſay you) <hi>bycauſe it is decreed, that no man builde a Church, before the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of that dioceſſe come and ſet vp a Croſſe.</hi> By the ſame reaſon, the ring of the church dore is a piece of Gods ſeruice too. For as the fixing of a Croſſe, the pitching of a ſtake (as it were) in the grounde, doth ſhewe that the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop hath limitted out the compaſſe of the Church: ſo the other is a proufe of Induction of the Prieſt. Yet, as thys ſigne of poſſeſſion taken, is no parte of duety within the Church diſcharged: ſo the other ſigne of authoritie to builde, giuen: is no parte of ſeruice within the building to be done. And this is the poynte which in this article ye go about to proue, <hi>that euery Church and Chappel,</hi> muſt haue a Croſſe erected in it, to the honor and ſeruice of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. But this Croſſe ſerueth an other turne, to a ciuill pollicy, &amp; no poynt of religion: For leaſt that men ſhould preſume to builde Churches without authoritie ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, it was decréed, that the byſhop of the dioceſſe, ſhould viewe the place, appoynte where the body of the Church ſhould be, &amp; leaue his mark behinde him. Which marke, might as wel haue bene his croſier, as his Croſſe: but that the one was leſſe chargeable than the other. If ye credite not me, turne ouer your Decree. There ſhall ye finde, that ordre is taken for thinges neceſſary, before the Church be builded. But we doe inquire what is neceſſary ſeruice in a Church hallowed? Wherefore I ſée not, how that Councell prouinciall, <hi>triginta trium Epiſcoporum,</hi> of thrée and thyrty byſhops, as the boke doth tell vs, can make any thing for you. But if there were moſt playne determination, for the Croſſe, in that or any other ſuch like Councell: I am no more bound to the authority ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, than you will be to the Engliſh Synodes, held in king Edwardes dayes, and in the Quéenes Maieſties raygne that nowe is. Yet the duety of a ſubiect (if ye were honeſt)
<pb facs="tcp:7817:66"/> might driue you to this: wheras there is no cauſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might enforce my conſent to the other. Nowe for your ſecond at <hi>Tovvres,</hi> whoſe Canon is this: <hi>Vt corpus dn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>i in altari, non in armario, ſed ſub Crucis titulo, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ponatur.</hi> Which you do engliſh after this ſort:<note place="margin">Foli. 40. b.</note> 
               <hi>That the body of our lord, conſecrated vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the altar, be not repoſed &amp; ſet in the reueſtry, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Roode.</hi> Where we may learne, two ſchole poynts of you. Fyrſt that <hi>armariu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> is latine for a Reueſtry. Then that <hi>titulus Crucis,</hi> is latine for a Roode. But if your ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers haue bene taught heretofore to tranſlate no better, a rod, a rod, had bene more méete for the vſher. For <hi>armariu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> may wel be taken for a librarie: for a cloſet, or almerie: but no more for the reueſtry, than for the belfry. Yet wil I not greatly in that word co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tend with you. Be it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh meaning, was for a reueſtry: yet doubtleſſe they were not ſo mad, as to put <hi>titulꝰ Crucis</hi> for a Roode. <hi>Titulus cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> title of the croſſe. And I maruel, that you wold not rather expound it for a Pixe, than a Roode: being driuen by this, to cary gods body ſacred, from the altar, into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Roode loft. We haue not heard afore this time, that the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was reuerently kept vnder the Roode, that the altar refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the Roode loft ſhuld be reuerenced. Now as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the ſixt general Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel kept at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in <hi>Trullo vvhereby</hi> (ye ſay) <hi>it may be gathered, that the ſigne of the Croſſe vvas kept &amp; had in Churches:</hi> I pray you alleage the canon of that Councel, out of which ye gather it. I am not ignorant, that in the Popes law it is cited ſo. But I am not yet perſuaded, that it is ſo. Belike the patchers of thoſe ragged reliques, miſſetoke the name of the .vj. for the .vij. For as it is certayne that in the ſyxt Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> there was a long diſcourſe <hi>contra Monothelitas,</hi> agaynſt them which affirmed, there was but one will in Chriſt: ſo in all the actions that are come abrode to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſight of the world, there is not ſo much as mention of the croſſe.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7817:66"/> It is an eaſy matter to ſay: Such a Councel defined ſo the caſe, &amp; bring no proufe at al, nor ſo much as a word, to rule the caſe ouer.

            <p>Which wordes in Engliſh be theſe.</p>
            <p>We, following therein, the pure and inuiolable faith, deliuered from God, receyued of holy fathers and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels, do ſay: that no man ought to ymagine, a diuiſion or confuſion, contrary to the true ſenſe and wyll not able to be expreſſed: and the ſame vnion being aboue reach of knowlege, of two natures agreable to one perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For what a mad opinion is this of paynters, who for fyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy lucres ſake, endeuour to make thoſe thinges that can not be made: and go about wyth their wicked handes, to
<pb facs="tcp:7817:68"/> expreſſe counterfets of thoſe things, which are onely wyth heart and mouth acknowleged? Vndoubtedly ſuch was the iudgement of him, that called the Image it ſelf, Chriſt: But Chriſt is by this name both God and man: it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth then, that it is the Image of God and man. And that alſo followeth: that either according to their vayne opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he hath circumſcribed the deitie <hi>(shut vp the Godhead vvithin a compaſſe)</hi> the which can not be circumſcribed <hi>(or limitted his rovvme)</hi> as is the nature created: or that he hath confounded, by confuſion moſt wicked, that vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and knitting together of the two natures, which are inconfuſible, <hi>(and in themſelues diſtinct)</hi> and ſo by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription and confuſion, hath committed agaynſt the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head a double blaſphemy. Such therfore as worſhip them, are enwrapped in the ſame blaſphemies, and the curſe is rewarde to eyther of them: in that they haue erred wyth <hi>Arrius, Dioſcorus,</hi> and <hi>Eutiches:</hi> and ſuch alſo as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected wyth the hereſie of the <hi>Acephali.</hi> Notwithſtanding they being conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned of men of vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, in that they haue atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted to paynt the diuine nature of Chriſt, which is not only not to be meaſured &amp; bounded in, but alſo not to be comprehended <hi>(or by vvit compryſed)</hi> do flée through their vngracious inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to ſome other defence. That we do ſet forth alone the Image of that nature onely, of that (I ſay) which we haue ſéene, handled, and bene conuerſant with. And that is very wicked and a diueliſh deuiſe of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorius.</hi> This alſo is further to be conſidered: that if ſo be according to the minde of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right beleuing fathers, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh, which is not onely fleſh, but the fleſh of the ſonne of God, did neuer learne the way to be deuided, but the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the diuinitie receyued, and perfect deitie therevnto was taken: How ſhall it of theſe wicked ones, which ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour this thing, be deuided into two: and eche by it ſelf be ſeparated? Like is the ſtate &amp; condition of his ſacred ſoule.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7817:68"/> For after ſuch time as the Godhead of the ſonne, had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpted in proper perſon, the nature of fleſh, the ſoule placed hir ſelfe a meane, betwene the deitie and the groſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the fleſh: &amp; as that fleſh was not only meare fleſh, but alſo the fleſh of God the worde: euen ſo the ſoule, not onely an humaine ſoule, but alſo the ſoule of God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word. And both together being ſeene (that is to ſay, the ſoule and the body) the godhead remayned as inſeparable fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, yea &amp; that euen in the ſeparation it ſelfe of the ſoule from the body, in that paſſion, which willingly he ſuffered. For whereſoeuer the ſoule of Chriſt is, there is alſo the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. And where the body of Chriſt is, there is alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. If that therefore the Godhead could not be ſeparate from theſe in the paſſion, how do theſe mad men (as raſh, &amp; altogether vnreaſonable) make a diuiſion of fleſh, ioyned with the diuinitie, &amp; deified? and attempt to paint theſame as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Image of a naturall man only, &amp; no more? And forth of this, they ſlip into another bottomleſſe pit of impietie. For in that they do ſeparate the humaine nature from the diuinity, &amp; do bring in the ſame ſubſiſting by it ſelf, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by do make another perſon in the fleſh, the which they ſay to be repreſented in the ymage: they do ioyne a fourth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the Trinitie, &amp; giue ſentence that the word of God is wicked. Therefore it muſt néedes follow of them which attempt to paynt Chriſt, that eyther they muſt ſay that the godhead is circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcriptible <hi>(ſuch as may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayned vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a certayne compaſſe)</hi> &amp; ſo confounded w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the fleſh: or els affirm, that the body of Chriſt is void of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godhead, &amp; diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp; moreouer a perſon by it ſelf ſubſiſting in the fleſh: &amp; ſo ioyne with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hereſie of <hi>Neſtoriꝰ,</hi> impugning gods truth. Forasmuch then, as they fal into ſuch blaſphemy &amp; impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, let them be aſhamed, let them abhorre themſelues, let them ceaſe to practiſe ſuch things: neyther they only which doe make them, but thoſe likewiſe which doe worſhip that
<pb facs="tcp:7817:69"/> which they make and vntruly name, the Image of Chriſt. Let therefore be farre from vs, (as reaſon requireth) aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well the diuiſion of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> as alſo the confuſion of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Dioſcorus, Eutiches,</hi> &amp; <hi>Seuerus,</hi> wickedly diſagreing one with another, and on eyther ſyde cauſing an impiety.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Engliſh of which words is this:</p>
            <p>The wicked calling of Images, by a falſe name, neither had his beginning by tradition from Chriſt, nor of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, or yet the auncient fathers, neither had it any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye prayer, where through to be ſanctified: but it remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth prophane, euen as it is wrought and finiſhed of the Paynter. But if certaine (deliuered of that errour) affirme, that we haue Godlily and vprightly ſaid, in thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing downe the Image of Chriſt, bicauſe of the inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inconfuſible ſubſtaunce of two natures ioyned in one perſon: Yet notwithſtanding ſome occaſion of doubt remayneth in them, as touching the Images of the virgin moſt glorious and vndefiled, the mother of God, of the Prophetes, Apoſtles and Martirs, ſeing that they be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, and no more: neyther doe conſiſt of two natures: that is to ſay, the diuine and humaine ioyned in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as before we haue ſignified to be in Chriſt, and the contrary therof practiſed in his Images: There groweth in déede ſome matter of doubt, as touching the Images of the moſt glorious and vndefiled mother of God, of the Prophets, Apoſtles &amp; Martirs, ſeing that they were only men, and not framed of two natures: what they be able to ſay to any purpoſe with reaſon vnto theſe. The former argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ouerthrowen, certaynly they haue nothing at all
<pb facs="tcp:7817:72"/> in this caſe to ſay. But what ſay we to ouerthrowing I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages? For as much as oure catholike Church, being a meane betwene the Iudaiſme and Gentilitie, hath recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued neyther of the maner of ſacrifices accuſtomed to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but hath entred into a newe way and order of Godlineſſe, and myſticall conſtitution giuen and deliuered of God: for it doth in no wiſe admit the bloudy ſacrifice and burnt offrings of the Iewes, &amp; it doth vtterly abhorre, not only al Idolatry in ſacrificing, but alſo multitude of ymages of Gentility, (for this was the head &amp; firſt moſt abhominable deuiſer of this arte: which (hauing no hope of reſurrection) inuented a toy, worthy it ſelf: wherby alwayes the abſent might be ſhewed as preſent) therefore ſynce this practiſe ſmelleth not of any noueltie, doubtleſſe let it be remoued moſt farre of from the Church of Chriſt, as a ſtrange and forren deuiſe of men, poſſeſſed with the Diuell. Let the tongs then of al ſuch, ſurceſſe, which ſpewe forth wicked &amp; blaſphemous things to the derogation of this our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; decrée, moſt acceptable to god. As for the holy men who pleaſed God, &amp; which were honored by him, with the dignity of holyneſſe, although that they be departed hence, yet that deade and hatefull practiſe, ſhal neuer make them agayne alyue. But whoſoeuer (poyſoned with the error of the heathen) ſhall attempt to ſette vp Images to them, he ſhall be adiudged as one that hath committed blaſphemie. And how dare the raſcall occupation of Gentiles, preſume to paynt that moſt prayſeworthy mother of God, whome the fulneſſe of the Godheade hath ouerſhadowed, through whome hath ſhone vpon vs that lighte, which can not be come vnto: that mother, (I ſay) higher than the Heauens, holier than the Cherubins? Againe why feare they not (I ſay) according to the arte of Ethnicks to counterfet them, which ſhall raygne with Chriſt, &amp; ſhall ſyt on ſeates wyth him to iudge the world: conformed vnto him in glory, of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7817:72"/> whome the world was vnworthy, as the Godly miracles affirme? Verily it is not lawful for Chriſtians (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) to vſe the order of worſhipping of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels. Neyther yet doth it beſeme, by vile and deade kinde of matter to reproch them, the which ſhal ſhine in ſo great &amp; paſſing glory. As for vs, we vſe not to receyue of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers demonſtrations of our fayth, neyther yet in Diuels to require teſtimony. Furthermore (our ſentence ſearched and diſcuſſed both out of the ſcripture enſpired fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue, &amp; out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> effectuall teſtimonies of piked fathers, agreing w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs, and affirming our good intent) we wyl exhibite in thys caſe our reſolute determination: which he ſhall not be able to gayneſay, which laboreth to call theſe things in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As for him that is ignorant, let him learne and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, that theſe things are take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the word of God. Fyrſt we place before the reſt, this ſentence of gods voice, ſaying: God is a ſpirite: whoſoeuer wil worſhip God, in ſpirite and truth, let him worſhip. And agayne. No man at any time ſaw God: neyther haue ye heard his voyce or ſéene his ſhape. Bleſſed are thoſe which haue not ſene, and yet belieued. And in the olde Teſtament, he ſayd to Moſes and the people: Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Image, neyther the likeneſſe of any thing in Heauen aboue, or in the earth beneath. For the which cauſe, you hearde the voyce of his wordes in the mountayne, in the middeſt of fyre, but his ſhape ye ſaw not: but onely heard his voyce. And: They haue chaunged the glory of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall God, by an Image framed after the ſhape of a mortall man, and they haue honored and worſhipped the things which are created, aboue him which hath created. And againe. For yf we haue knowen Chriſt according to the fleſhe: now we knowe hym not. For we walke by faith, and not by the outward appearance. And this alſo which is moſte plainlie ſpoken of the Apoſtle: Therefore fayth
<pb facs="tcp:7817:73"/> commeth of hearing: but hearing commeth by the worde of God. For if we haue knowen Chriſt according to the fleſhe, nowe we knowe him not. For we walke by fayth, and not by outwarde appearaunce. The very ſelfe ſame things our Godly Fathers, (the ſchollers and ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles) doe teache vs. For <hi>Epiphanius</hi> of <hi>Cypres,</hi> (moſt famous amongſt the foremoſt) thus ſayth: Take héede vnto your ſelues, that ye kéepe the traditions, which ye haue receyued: Sée ye leane not, neyther to the ryght hand, nor to the left. Vnto which, he addeth theſe words: Remembre deare children, that ye bring no Images into the Church: neyther place them, in the ſléeping places of the ſainctes: but ſée that continually ye earye aboute in your heart, the Lorde. Neyther yet let them be ſuffered in a common houſe. For it is not lawefull for a Chriſtian, to be holden in ſuſpenſe by his eyes, but by the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of his minde. The ſame father alſo in many other of hys ſermons, hath declared many things touching the ouerthrow of Images: which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtudious ſéeking for, ſhall eaſely finde. Likewyſe alſo <hi>Gregorie</hi> the diuine, ſaith in his verſes: It is a thing moſt abhominable, to beleue in colours, and not in heart: For that which is in colours is eaſyly waſhed away: but ſuche thinges as are in the depth of the minde, thoſe lyke I well. Iohn Chriſoſtome alſo teacheth thus: we through writing, enioye the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Sainctes, although that we haue not the Images of their bodyes, but of their ſoules, for thoſe things which are ſpoken by them, are Images of theire ſoules. <hi>Baſilius</hi> alſo the great ſaith: that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefeſt thing ſeruing to the outfinding of truthe, is the meditation of the Scriptures, giuen vnto vs by diuine inſpiration. For in theſe, not onely arguments of things are founde: but alſo the written liues of holy men are printed vnto vs, as certaine liuely Images, and that through the polityke
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7817:73"/> imitation of their workes, according to God. Alſo <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> the light of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſayde: howe are they not to be lamented, which worſhip creatures? that thoſe that ſée, yeld ſeruice to thoſe which are blind? thoſe that heare, do pray and beſech thoſe, which are altogether deafe? For the creature, ſhall neuer be ſaued of a creature. Lykewiſe <hi>Amphilochius</hi> byſhop of <hi>Iconium,</hi> thus ſayth: We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt it a matter of no eſtimation, to counterfet in tables wyth colours, the bodyly countenaunces of the Sainctes, bycauſe that of theſe we haue no nede: But we ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be mindefull of the pollicy of their vertues. Agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble alſo herevnto, doth <hi>Theodorꝰ</hi> biſhop of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> teach, in theſe wordes: We iudge it nothing ſéemely at all, to make the formes and ſhapes of holy men wyth materiall coloures: but it is requiſit, that we often repayre &amp; make freſh their vertues, which by writings are deliuered vnto vs, euen as though it were certayne lyuely Images. For by theſe, we may come to the zelous following of the like. Let thoſe tell vs, which ſet vp the ſame. Images, what profyte they haue by them? whether they haue any kinde of remembrance, by ſuch ſpecial kinde of beholding them? But it is moſt appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that euery ſuch thought is vayne, and an inuention of diueliſh deceyt. Likewiſe alſo <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius Pamphili,</hi> ſignified after this ſort, to <hi>Conſtantia</hi> the Empreſſe, crauing of him to ſende the Image of Chriſt vnto hir: For as much as ye haue wrytten to me of the Image of Chriſt, that I ſhould ſend it vnto you: I would you ſhoulde ſhewe me, what thing you thinke the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Chriſt to be? whether that ſame true and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaungeable creature, bearing the markes of the deitie: or that, which he aſſumpted for oure ſakes, taking on him the ſhape of a ſeruaunte? But as touching the picture of the deitie, I iudge ye be not very carefull:
<pb facs="tcp:7817:74"/> in aſmuch as ye haue bene taught of him, that none hath knowen the Father, but the Sonne: and that none hath worthyly knowen the Sonne, but the Father which begatte him. And after other thinges: but ye altogether deſire the Image of the ſeruauntes ſhape, and of the fleſh which he toke on him for our ſake: but we haue learned that this is coupled with the glory of the Godheade, and that the ſame ſuffred &amp; dyed. And a little after: Who can therfore counterfet by dead &amp; inſenſible colours, by vayne ſhadowing Paynters arte, the bright &amp; ſhining gliſtering of ſuch hys glory? whereas his holy diſciples were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to beholde the ſame in the mountayne? Who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore falling on their faces, acknowledged they were not able to beholde ſuch a ſyght. If therefore the ſhape of fleſhe, receyued ſuche power of the Godhead, dwelling within the ſame: what ſhall we then ſay, when as it hath now putte of mortalitie, waſhing away corruption: and hath chaunged the ſhape of a ſeruaunt, into the glory of the Lorde and God? What ſhall we ſay now, after hys victorie ouer death? after his aſcending into heauen? af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his ſytting in the kingly throne on the right hande of his Father? after reſte, in the not vtterable ſecretes of the Father, into the which he aſcending and ſytting, the heauenly powers, thoſe bleſſed ones, wyth voyces toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do crye: Ye Princes lyft vp your gates, ye heauenly gates be ye opened, and the King of glorie ſhall enter in? Theſe fewe teſtimonies therefore of Scriptures and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, out of many, we haue placed here in this our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination: auoyding in déede multitude, leaſt the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould be too prolixe: and abſtayning of purpoſe from the reſidue (which be infinite) that thoſe which luſte may themſelues ſéeke them. Being therefore throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, by theſe Scriptures (inſpired from God, and by
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7817:74"/> the iudgementes of the bleſſed Fathers, ſtaying our féete vpon the rocke) of the worſhippe of God in ſpirite: we which are girded wyth the dignitie of the prieſthode, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one minde and iudgement, aſſembled together in one place, doe wyth one voyce determine in the name of the holy, ſuperſubſtantiall and quickning Trinitie, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Image made by Paynters wicked arte, of any kinde of matter, is to be remoued forth of the Church of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as that which is ſtraunge and abhominable. Let no man fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this time forward, (of what ſtate ſoeuer he be) fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe any ſuch kinde of wicked &amp; vncleane cuſtome. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer therfore fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this day forward, ſhall preſume, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for himſelf any image, or to worſhip it, either to ſet it in a Church, or in any priuate houſe, or elſe to kepe it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretely: if he be a Byſhoppe or a Deacon, let him be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: but if he be a priuate perſon, or of the laye fée, lette him be accurſed, and ſubiecte to the Emperiall decrées, as one which withſtandeth the commaundementes of God, and kepeth not his doctrine.</p>

It ſuffiſeth now that I haue ſet forth to you the beſt part of the actes of the noble Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel, ye ſée the learned rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that they made: the depe and profou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d iudgements: the pyth, the ſtrength, the marowbones of their matter, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyth they dyd ſo begreaſe themſelues, that now they ſhine ſo glorious in your eyes. If men had deuiſed matter to mocke them wythall, I ſuppoſe they could not haue found any, ſo abſurde as they brought with them. Yet theſe be they, that repreſented the ſtate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vniuerſal Church. Theſe be they that could not erre. Theſe be they that you onely depend on. Theſe be the thrée hundreth and fyfty byſhops, that condemned the thrée hundreth and eyght and thyrty that were before aſſembled at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Theſe be the Iudges, that gaue ſentence agaynſt the Counſell gathered in Spayne. Theſe be the worthy pillers, that beare vp the Croſſe &amp; Images. And if a man conſidered by what ſpirite they were led, when they came to <hi>Nice,</hi> he neded not to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtrange &amp; horrible ſucceſſe of their doings. For who then bare the ſway? Who did aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble them, but that <hi>Athalia</hi> that Ieſabel <hi>Irene:</hi> which was ſo bewitched with ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that al order, al honeſty, al law of nature broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not what ſhe did, ſo ſhe might haue hir Mawmots. She burned hir fathers bones. She murthered hir owne ſonne. She peruerted by violence al order of lawful Counſel, that ſhe might goe a whoring with hir Idols ſtyll. When Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine the fift, father to hir huſbande <hi>Leo,</hi> (by mariage of whome, ſhe moſte vnworthy came to hir eſtate) had lien dead &amp; buried a good while in his graue, ſhe digged him vp:
<pb facs="tcp:7817:87"/> ſhe ſhewed hir crueltie on his carcaſe, ſhe caſt his bones into the fier, &amp; cauſed his aſhes to be throwen into the ſea: This did the good daughter, the defender of Images, bycauſe hir father, when as yet he liued, had broken them in pieces, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, ſimplicity rather than ſumpteouſneſſe, to be moſte ſitting for the Church of Chriſt. Thus raged ſhe during the none age of Conſtantine hir ſonne, and made the palace of Conſtantinople, a ſinke of ſectaries: a follower of deformed Rome. But when the Emperor himſelfe (hir ſonne) grew to diſcretion, he trode in his fathers and grandfathers ſteps: and did ſo much miſlyke with his mothers Mawmetry, that he began to brydle hir inſolent affection: he toke the ſweard out of hir mad handes, and threwe downe the monumentes of ſuperſtition, which ſhe (with ſuch diligence and coſte) had erected. Wherevpon, the malice of hir wicked breaſt was ſo incenſed, that ſhe ſpared not to ſet on fier hir owne houſe: to conſpire the death of hir owne childe: only to maintaine hir Images in the Church. Therefore ſhe not onely forgate hir duety to hir Prince, hir loue to hir ſonne, but ſhe ioyned with a ſorte of cut throtes: ſhe vtterly caſt of the nature and condition of a woman: ſhe became more ſauage than a wild beaſt. For beſide that ſhe craftely betrayed the Emperour, ſhe trayterouſly bereued him of his inheritance the crowne: ſhe moſt vnwomanly ſcratched out the eyes of the ſame hir owne ſonne: ſhe moſt abhominably caſte him into pryſon: moſt deteſtably at length ſhe murthered him. Thus was the liuing for the deade, the Prince for a puppet: the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall childe deſtroyed for the naked vnnaturall vſe of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry. And to declare the wrath of God iuſtly deſerued for this execrable facte, <hi>Eutropius</hi> reporteth thus: <hi>Obtenebratus est ſol per dies ſeptemdecim, &amp; non dedit radios ſuos, ita vt errarent naues maris, omnes<expan>

But on the contrary ſide, he proued, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had as many Croſſes, as the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. For, their banners and enſignes, what wer they but gilded and adorned Croſſes: Their ſpoyles of enemyes caryed on the ſpeares poynte, the noble ſignes of their vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant victory, repreſented not onely the faſhion of a Croſſe, but alſo the Image of a man nayled on it. So that the ſigne of a Croſſe is naturally ſene in the ſhip ſayling: the ploughe earing: the man praying. And among the reſt, I thinke (as you ſaye) that there is no Church can ſtande without it. For vnleſſe ye haue the Croſſe beames and the Croſſe pyllers, with one pece of timber ſhut into an other, (which is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſigne of a Croſſe) I can not tell, howe the building can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde.

If a Croſſe be ſo neceſſary, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loke on the roofes and walles of your houſes, and there ſhal ye fynde as ſubſtantiall a Croſſe, as in the Roode loft or vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the altare. If the ſigne of a Croſſe muſt nedes be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped (as you in euery place do teach) then by Ambroſe hys reaſon, we are aſwell bounde to adore and worſhip the ſaile
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7817:88"/> of the ſhip: the plough of the field: the windes of the aire, and the armes of a man. For in the ſame place alleaged by you, where the Croſſe is extolled, theſe ſignes are mentioned: <hi>Hoc dominico ſigno ſcinditur mare, terra colitur, caelum regitur, homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes couſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tur.</hi> By thys ſigne of our Lord, the ſea is cut: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is plowed: the ſkye is ruled: and men be preſerued.

For the cuſtomes are not to be embraced for the countrey ſake: but rather the countrey for the cuſtom ſake.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7817:98"/> Choſe ye therfore out of al Churches whatſoeuer they are, the thynges that are Godly, religious and good, and theſe beyng gathered into one bundel, repoſe them as cuſtomes in the Engliſh mennes hartes. So that of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wyſe, it hath bene alwayes reputed folly, to ſticke to preſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of tyme or place.

Wherfore ye haue no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage of me, in that I graunted the vſe of Croſſing, to be auncient in the Church. For if it had bene well in oure forefathers, yet by Auguſtines rule, it might be ill in vs: and therfore to be altered. And ſtifly to defende one certain cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, without apparant commodity to the Church, is by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> hymſelfe diſproued. Only I am ſory, that imperfections of wiſe men haue gyuen ſuch preſident of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to the wilfull. I am loth to ſaye that the fathers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, were not ſo wel affected as they ought. But ye driue me to lay my finger on thys ſore, and continually to ſcratch it. The tale of <hi>Probianus,</hi> which ye cyte out of <hi>Sozomene</hi> in the Tripartite hiſtory,<note place="margin">Folio. 48.</note> hath ſmall apparance of truth in it. For if he adored not the materiall Croſſe, he was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſtian for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>: but if he beleued not the death of Chriſt, then was he not conuerted vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fayth at al. For without Chriſt, and the ſame crucified, our fayth is all in vayne. Wherfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is ſayd, <hi>that he vvould not vvorship the cauſe of our ſaluation,</hi> either the writer of this hyſtory, doth il apply thys to the worde materiall: or you do ill apply it to your purpoſe. It ſhuld ſeme to be a tale, framed out of <hi>Conſtantinus</hi> apparition: when foliſh worſhippers of the Croſſe would ſtyl haue moe miracles, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. But as theues that haue robbed, do leaue alway ſome marke behynde them, wherby they may be knowen, eyther what they were, or which way they be gone: ſo thys author of yours, leaping ouer the pale, hath left a piece of hys cloke behynde hym, and ye may tracke hym by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foote.
<pb facs="tcp:7817:99"/> For if he ment (as your deuiſe) <hi>that euer ſince the death of Chriſt, vvhatſoeuer good hath ben vvrought to mankinde, either by good men, or holy Angels, the ſame hath bene vvrought, by the ſigne of the Croſſe:</hi> then Angels by lyke haue bodyes to beare it, haue ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des to make it. But Angels beyng miniſtring ſpirites,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.</note> haue from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning wrought many vertues for mans behoufe: haue bene by Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, a defence of the faythful, and ouerthrowe of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: yet can they not make any materiall Croſſe, ſuch as is ſet vp in Churches: nor yet myſticall, ſuch as men vſe to print in their foreheades: wherfore, eyther y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> collector of this tale was a lyer, or you a fonde applyer. Howſoeuer it falles out in ryme, yet the reaſon is good. But rather of the twoo I would excuſe the author, who by the Croſſe, ment Chriſt hys paſſion: and lay you in the fault, which vnderſtode him not. For doutleſſe if there were ſuch an apparitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bianus</hi> (as I am not yet perſuaded of) yet that the meaning of it, ſhould be ſuch as you ſay, <hi>to driue him to the vvorship of a Croſſe in earth,</hi> hath neyther religion, nor reaſon in it. Conſtantine hymſelfe, which was as newly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted to the fayth, neyther was commaunded to do the lyke, nor euer dyd it.

But ye féele not the ſtripes: I am very ſory for that: verely verely, ye haue well deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them. For if S. Cyprian, would not aſcribe ſo much vertue to the name of God, that it ſhould be able to do all: (otherwiſe than called vpon, which reſpecteth the fayth of the receyuer) ſhall we thinke that he had a ſory breaking of the ayre, wherby the Croſſe is made, in ſuch hie reuerence and admiration? On a time the ſame father was demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his iudgement, whether ſuch as were baptiſed bedred, were Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Cyprianus Magno Epist. <hi>64.</hi>

Your owne doctor doth ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw you. But ye cite two authorities of S. Auguſtine, to confirme your error. For the firſt where he ſayth.<note place="margin">Folio. <hi>49.</hi> b.</note> 
               <hi>With the myſterie of the Croſſe, the ignorant are inſtructed and taught, the font of regeneration is hallovved. &amp;c.</hi> I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere as I did before, according to the true meaning of the word <hi>(myſterie)</hi> that the meaning of the croſſe which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, and ſée not (for ſo Chriſoſtome<note place="margin">Chriſoſ. <hi>1.</hi> ad Cor. cap. <hi>2.</hi> Hom. <hi>7.</hi>
               </note> ſaith) and not the viſible and materiall Croſſe, worketh the effectes aforeſayd. For you wyll graunt me that the ſigne of the Croſſe is but an acceſſory thing. The ſubſtance of the ſacrament may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt wythout it. Auguſtine<note place="margin">Aug. in. Io. Tract. <hi>40.</hi> et de catacl. cap. <hi>3</hi>
               </note> ſayth not: <hi>Accedat Crucis ſignatio ad elementum, &amp; fit Sacramentum.</hi> Let the ſigne of the Croſſe concurre with the elemente, and it is a ſacramente. But, let the worde come to the element, and it is a ſacramente. And yet he doth not attribute ſo muche to the elemente it ſelfe, or to the worde, as you doe to the ſigne of the Croſſe. For of Baptiſme he ſayth: <hi>Vnde ista tanta virtus aquae, vt corpus tangat &amp; cor abluat, niſi faciente verbo? Non quia dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ſed quia creditur: Nam &amp; in ipſo verbo, aliud est ſonus tranſiens, aliud virtus manens.</hi> Whence commeth this ſo great vertue of the water to touch the body, and waſhe the ſoule, but by the working of the worde? not bycauſe the worde is ſpoken, but bycauſe it is belieued. For in the worde it ſelfe, the ſound that paſſeth, is one thing, and the vertue remayning, another. If onely fayth bring effecte to ſacramentes, if the worde it ſelfe be not auayleable wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beliefe, ſhall we thinke that S. Auguſtine made ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
<pb facs="tcp:7817:102"/> of the ſigne of a Croſſe? In déede he made great of the myſterie of the Croſſe, bicauſe on it onely dependeth fayth. But the myſterie, you haue nothing to doe withal. For vnleſſe it be a materiall Croſſe, or a Croſſe made with a fynger in ſome part of the body, ye profeſſe that in thys treatiſe ye will ſpeake of none.<note place="margin">Folio. 24.</note> And now to the ſeconde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation out of Auguſtine. As the maner of ſigning with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Croſſe was in his time vſual: ſo wold I wiſh for your own ſake, that ye could content your ſelf with his ſignifications, and wade no further in ſo daungerous a puddle, than he hath dypped his fote before you. Wel doth he pleaſe himſelf in a ſubtile deuiſe of his, when he wil referre the Apoſtles wordes. Ephe. <hi>3.</hi> to the figure of the Croſſe, meaning by the breadth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is ſpoken of, Charity: by height, Hope: by length, Pacience: by depth, Humilitie. But theſe make no more for Paules meaning, than the Geometricall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Ambroſe, out of the ſame place gathereth. Onely there is ſome edification in the wordes: and though ye ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them to your moſt aduauntage,<note place="margin">Folio. <hi>48.</hi> b.</note> yet can ye not inferre your purpoſe of them. For you would haue it appeare, that no Sacrament, were made and perfected rightly, wythout the ſigne of the Croſſe.<note place="margin">Trac. in. Ioa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>118.</hi>
               </note> But Auguſtine goeth not ſo farre. Onely he ſayth. <hi>Nihil eorum rite perficitur.</hi> None of them is ſolemnly done, and according to the receyued order. For are you (M. Lawyer) ignoraunte of this common poſition among the Ciuilians, <hi>Quod (recte) iusticia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cauſae (rite) ſolennita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem respicit?</hi> That this terme <hi>(recte)</hi> hath reſpecte vnto the righteouſneſſe and truth of the cauſe, but <hi>(rite)</hi> which is the word that Auguſtine vſeth, doth go no farther than to the order and ſolemnitie thereof? So I graunt you well, that in Auguſtines tyme, if there wanted a Croſſe, there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a ceremony: and yet were the ſacraments perfect not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding. In our Church of England, a Croſſe is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to be made in baptiſme: yet was it neuer thought

Go to your Canon, where order is taken <hi>Vt omnia Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta Crucis ſignaculo perficiantur:</hi> That all Sacraments ſhal be made perfect with the ſigne of the Croſſe: Yet in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gloſe vpon the ſame place, ye ſhall finde twiſe in one leafe, theſe words: <hi>Non remouet quin aliter poſsint ſanctificari, &amp; valere ad remiſsionem, ſed refert factum nec aliter fit ſolennis baptiſmus.</hi> He doth not take away this, but that otherwiſe, (that is to ſay, without the ſigne of the Croſſe) they may be ſanctifyed, and the thing be auayleable vnto remiſſion. But it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that the thing be done (that is to ſay the ſigne of the Croſſe be made) <hi>nor othervviſe it is a ſolemne baptiſme.</hi> This is the Popes lawe, and your goſpell. Wherefore I beſech you (good ſolemne ſir) be not ſo harde maſter to vs: that for default of ſolemnity,<note place="margin">Folio. 50. a,</note> we ſhal be defaulked of fruite of Sacramentes. As for Chriſoſtome (I haue anſwered you oft) he ſpeaketh of a Croſſe that you haue nothing to doe withal. It is to heauy for you to beare. It is not to be ſéene as yours, but to be felt as ours. Then trouble not your ſelf more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye nede. We are agréed by this time, Chriſoſtom, and you, &amp; I, and al, that a Croſſe we muſt haue.

Wherfore ye muſt bring better proues than theſe, or elſe ye ſhall be ſure to fayle of your purpoſe.

And what conclude ye of it? <hi>That in as much as neyther Angels, nor men, haue euer done any thing for the vveale of man, vvithout the ſigne of the Croſſe: therefore no Sacraments can be made vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

And firſt, where ye ſnatch a piece of Auguſtine, wherin he calleth the Chriſme a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I anſwere: that he attributeth no more therto, than otherwiſe to praier, and to the word of God. Yea the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sentences hymſelfe teacheth you: that many thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges improperly be called Sacramentes, which muſt not in
<pb facs="tcp:7817:107"/> reaſoning, be numbred among the Sacramentes of Chriſt his Church. But if on thys ſort euery ſigne viſible, and the ſame holy, be a Sacrament with you: then ſhall euery I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in the Church, be a Sacrament. For they be ſignes, and you ſay they be holy.<note place="margin">Mark. 10.</note> As for the example of Chriſt, who embraced little children in hys armes, and laying hys han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des vpon their heades, bleſſed them, I anſwere: that as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery fact of Chriſt, doth not ſerue for our imitation, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: ſo muſt we not make a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of eche of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For ſo the breathing vpon hys Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Iohn. 20.</note> whereby he gaue them the holy ghoſt, ſhould be a Sacrament. Onely, thys ſigne may be a preſident for vs, that children appertaine to the kingdome of God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ought not be denyed the ſigne, which are partakers of the grace, &amp; therfore ſhould be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed. Then afterwarde, if ye will haue them confirmed, I alow it well: retayning that order, which in the primitiue Church was, and in the Engliſh Church is vſed. That chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, after certaine yeares, be preſented to the biſhop, and rendring an accompt, of that fayth of theirs (which by their ſuerties in baptiſme they profeſſed) haue ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des layd on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:<note place="margin">De bap. cont Don. lib. <hi>3.</hi> Cap. <hi>16.</hi>

One thing will I aſke of theſe apyſhe imitators: if they wyll grounde vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt hys doing their Confirmation: how dare they preſume to doe more than Chriſt dyd? Whence haue they their oyle? Who gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> authoritie, to exhibite what ſigne of the holy ghoſt they would? What promiſe haue they of grace, annexed vnto their Sacrament, vnleſſe they haue ſhut the holy ghoſt in their greaſe pot? They apply, I know, whatſoeuer is ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the grace of Gods ſpirite, to thys. But ineptly. For Chriſt ſayth ſimply:<note place="margin">Luc. 11.</note> that God will giue hys good ſpirite to them that aſke it. And to the faythfull, that he wyll not

               <pb facs="tcp:7817:108"/> Is the confirmation (which you call a Sacrament) ordained to be ſo from heauen,<note place="margin">Mat. 21.</note> or of men? If it be of men, it is no Sacrament. If it be of God, then ſhew the worde. Ye haue the example of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles in the. cha. 8. and .19. of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Actes.<note place="margin">Folio. 54 a. Actes. 8.</note> But no exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple ſuffiſeth for a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. The Apoſtles the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vſurped not ſo much. But ſée how well ye folow the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. When the Apoſtles, which were at Hieruſalem, heard ſay, that Samaria had receaued the worde of God, they ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto them Peter and Iohn: which when they were come down, prayed for them, that they myght receyue the holy ghoſt. For as yet, he was come down on none of them, but they were baptiſed only, in the name of the Lorde Ieſus. Then layd they their handes on them and they receyued the holy ghoſt. Now, are ye ignoraunt what here is ment by the holy ghoſt? I wyl tel you. The gift to ſpeake in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe languages: to worke miracles: and other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler graces of the holy ſpirite. And although they had recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the common grace of adoption &amp; regeneration through baptiſme, yet had they not, theſe other qualities, which in the beginning of the Church were graunted, and now be denyed. So that laying on of handes, ſerued to good vſe then, when it pleaſed God at inſtance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles praiers to conferre the viſible graces of hys ſpirite: but now, that there is no ſuch miniſtery in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church: now that miracles be ceaſſed, to what ende ſhould we haue thys impoſition of handes? the ſigne without the thyng? If a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould now a dayes, proſtrate hymſelfe vpon the bodyes of the dead, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Helias and Paul, vſed thys ceremony, in rayſing of their dead, ſhould he not be thought prepoſterouſly to doe? So that it might well be a kynde of Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles tyme, but the cauſe ceaſſing, what ſhould y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſigne continue? Yet ye content not your ſelues, with the Apoſtles order: ye wyll (as I ſayd before) haue ſomewhat of your owne. For neyther Peter, nor Iohn, annoynted the Samaritanes: but

But whoſoeuer ſeketh ſaluation in the Chriſmatory, ſhalbe ſure to loſe it in Chriſt. Oyle for the belly: and the belly for oyle, but the Lord ſhall deſtroy both the one and the other. Good Lorde: what beaſt but a papiſt, what papiſt but a diuell, durſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſay, that ſaluation ſhould be fet out of an oyle box? The Apoſtle calleth vs from impote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and beggerly things:<note place="margin">Gala. 4.

For ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is a ceremonie, that is taken out of the word of God, &amp; a ſigne of ſpirituall grace conferred, as Paul doth witneſſe: yet am I not contrary to my ſelf herein, who before affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that there were onely .ij. ſacramentes of the Church: Baptiſme, and the Lords ſupper.

But where I attribute to Chriſtian miniſtery, ſo much as I ſpake of: there is no cauſe of pride for popiſh prieſts. For they ſwarue ſo farre from Chriſtes inſtitution, that they ſerue not at al for any godly purpoſe.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7817:116"/> Chriſt did ordayne hys Apoſtles to preache,<note place="margin">Ioh. 20.</note> and to that end he breathed on them, ſhewing by that ſigne, the power and vertue of the holy ghoſt, wherewithall he indued them: But the Romiſh apes, onely retaine the ſigne, the thyng it ſelfe beyng far theſt from them: and as for the end which Chriſt reſpected, they haue leaſt regarde of. For, they haue taught their prieſtes, that it is leaſt part of their duetye to preache: moſt to do ſacrifice, and ſay Maſſe. And thys doth the wordes of their inſtitution proue: &amp; a greate proc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of theirs <hi>Hoſius,</hi> affirme.

               </gap>, which he wyl haue to ſignify, ſacrifice. So in the ende to raiſe their own gain they derogate all from Chriſt hys death and hys paſſion. We know that Chriſt did offer hymſelfe ſufficiently: and made a perfect ſatiſfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our ſynnes: we know that he nedeth not any prieſtes helpe, to be as acceptable to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his ſeruice ſake, as Chriſt for that one, and onely Sacrifice of hys body was. Chriſt gaue commaundement to be faythfull miniſters, not bloudy coniurers: Chriſte gaue an iniunction to fede the flocke, not to offer Sacrifice. Chriſt hath promiſed his holy ghoſt, not to purge and take away ſynnes, but to mayntaine the Church, and kepe it in good order. And as for the argument that the moſt learned papiſtes do builde vpon, the greke worde, maye eaſely be anſwered. For Chriſoſtome when he had conſidered howe Paul had written, that he was a miniſter of Ieſus Chriſte conſecrating the goſpell (for ſo S. Auguſtine turneth it) that there might be an acceptable oblation and Sacrifice of the Gentiles, ſayth:<note place="margin">Rom. 15.</note> that the Apoſtle there did make full men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of all the Sacrifice that he could make, vſing both the

Thys is my Sacrifice, to preach the Goſpell ſayth he: my ſworde is the goſpell, my Sacrifice is the Gentiles. And now would I fayne ſée, what theſe inchanters can ſay, bragging themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues therefore to be prieſts, bicauſe they can iuggle ſo finely, that thinges ſhall paſſe out of their nature by them. The prieſthode and Sacrifice that the Apoſtles had, was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the ſimple ſoules, to dawnt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cruell courages of men, to make an offering of them vnto the Lord: not throughe groſſe miracle, or by bluddy knife, but by the ſpiritual ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure of the power of God: whereby counſayles are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen, and euery hygh thyng that auaunceth it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God,<note place="margin">2.

And whoſoeuer will be ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors vnto the Apoſtles, muſt vſe thys miniſtery, this trade of doctrine: which if they continue in, being lawfully called therunto by God, and haue giftes competente to approue their calling vnto the world, they nede not to care for the ſigne of the Croſſe, to be imprinted in them, the vertue wherof neuer departeth from them. Certayne it is, that neyther Scripture, nor any learned father, commendeth any bleſſing, but of prayer to vs. And how your wiſedome doth eſteme the wagging of a biſhops fingers, I greatly force not. I loked rather, that ye ſhould haue commended the oyle for anointing, which the greaſy marchauntes wyll haue in euery meſſe.

               <hi>All Sacramentes of the Church</hi> (as Auguſtyne ſayth) <hi>are made vvith the ſigne of the Croſſe. but Matrimony, Pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nance, and Extreme vnction, are Sacraments of the Church: Therfore the ſigne of the Croſſe is vſed in them.</hi> For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere wherof, neither is the firſt propoſition, (as you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande it) to be admitted: nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeconde in any wyſe is true. Therfore the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion doth follow but ill fauoredly. Firſt ye are abuſed in your own conceite, in eſteming the ſigne of the Croſſe, to be a thyng of ſuch neceſſitie, as that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes may not be made without it: whereas it is but an acceſſory thyng, deuiſed by man, wherof in Scripture we haue no preſident. And Auguſtine woulde not ſaye (as you fondly do) that ſimplely Sacramentes are made wyth the ſigne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Croſſe:<note place="margin">Ser. <hi>181.</hi> De tempore.</note> but mentioning that, as a piece of a ceremony more than neded, brought in withall the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poynt, (that you leaue out) the calling vpon the name of Chriſt.

And in baptiſme, the water &amp; ſprinckling therof in the name of the father y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne and the holy ghoſt, vpon the party that is to be chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, is the whole ſigne and ceremony to be done.

Nor in Chriſtes inſtitution we heare any mention of ſuch a ceremony, nor that Chriſt in hys own baptiſme, nor the Apoſtles in theirs, were bleſſed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a finger.

For before Gregories tyme, although euery man graunted Matrimony to be an holy ordinance of God: yet who euer affirmed it to be a ſacrament? Forſoth (ſay you) <hi>Ambroſe, Auguſtine,</hi> and <hi>Leo.</hi> So y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame Ambroſe calleth the wordes and workes of Chriſt, wherby he ſhewed hys diuinitie, hidden otherwyſe in God, a ſacrament.<note place="margin">In ep. ad.

So that, if ye take a ſacrament for that, wherby any thyng is ſignified vnto vs, then Matrimonye I graunt may be a ſacrament. But ſée what abſurditie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues thereon. As many parables as we haue in ſcripture, ſo many ſacramentes. The graine of muſtarde ſéede: the goodwyfes leauen: the dore of the houſe: the ſhepehearde: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> giant: the thefe (for by all theſe, the kyngdome of God, and Chriſt are ſignified) muſt be ſacramentes. So the waſhing of handes: the ſhaking of duſt from the Apoſtles féete: and euery act of Chriſt, may be a ſacrament. Then we ſhal not kepe vs within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> number of ſeaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (which you appoynt) but ere we haue done, we ſhall haue ſeuen ſcore, yea ſeuen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſacramentes.

If euery example that we reade in ſcripture, ſhall be followed of vs, If euery thing that was a ſigne to other ſhal be a ſacrament to vs: then duſt and ſpittle, ſhal be a ſacrament to heale ſore eyes.

To purchaſe more credit to it, they had made a little windowe eaſtwarde, where the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſunne might glimmer in, &amp; taking the iuſt heyght of their idol, ſhuld ſhine no lower nor higher than they wold: but that, when their God was ſhrined, might be full in his face, and vpon his lippes. And ſo by this meanes a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle was wrought, the ſunne with a kiſſe, bad him welcome to Church. Agayne, where the nature of the Lodeſtone is to draw iron to it, they made (as curiouſly as workmanſhip could deuiſe) the Image of the ſonne in iron: that whereas the ſunne was in the vawte, &amp; the Image directely vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath it, the Image ſometime, might riſe and hang in the ayre. But leaſt the ponderoſitie of the metall, might come to his courſe agayne, they conueyed it away, and ſayde: The ſunne hath now taken his leaue of <hi>Serapis,</hi> and gone
<pb facs="tcp:7817:142"/> to his buſineſſe. Theſe and ſuch other inuentions they had to deceyue the people. Such hayes they pitched to purchas their profit. But theſe were but groſſe, in reſpect of the fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our pariſh prieſts, and popiſh Chaplens. For they haue made Roodes, with rowling eyes, &amp; ſweating browes: with ſpeaking mouth, and walking féete.

The ſilly huſband was glad, that he had any thing to do his God a pleaſure: &amp; therfore would deck hir &amp; trim hir vp, in hir holyday aray: and to Church ſhe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, with penny in hir purſe, &amp; taper in hir hand, to offer for hir ſinnes: The prieſt, before al the people, ſhuts y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church dore, he leaues the woman within, and home he goeth.

Thus in concluſion, many honeſt mens wiues, many worſhipful &amp; honorable, vnder colour of holyneſſe, &amp; by mere hipocriſie, were inſtrumentes many yeares, to ſatiſfy the pleaſure of the filthy prieſt.

As for authorities (though Scripture it ſelfe doth ſuffiſe the faythfull, and ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite not to be contentious) yet that men of good iudgement, vtterly abhorred, as heatheniſh, diueliſh, and Idolatrous, this keping, incloſing, honoring of a piece of woode, or any ſuch earthly matter, I haue brought you <hi>Hierome</hi> &amp; <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,</hi> whoſe plaine words condemne the ſuperſtition of you, and al other that you do talke of.

He gaue him therefore a ſinguler prerogatiue, to be our Prophete, our maſter, and our guyde, commaunding him onely, no church, no councel, no man to be heard. The

What the ſynagoge of Antichriſt doth, I care not: what the true Chriſtians ought to do, I proue. Chriſt ſent forth his Apoſtles into the worlde, and gaue them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to teach and preach, not what ſoeuer they could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, but what he had fyrſt commaunded them.

Beleue no report, for it is a liar. Beware of the woluiſh generation, which now being hungry kept, and féeding vpon carrein, breath out nothing elſe, but horrible blaſphemies, and ſtinking lyes. They prate of good life, themſelues moſt licentious. They burden men with breach of lawes, themſelues moſt rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious and diſſolute. They goe about to diſcredit vs, as tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of carnall libertie, themſelues embrewed wyth all kinde of filth and abhomination. As for all their doctrine and religion, I may ſay vnto them, as Chriſt did to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes: <hi>Populus iste labijs me honorat, cor autem eorum longe eſt à me.</hi> This people honor me with their lips, but their heartes are farre of from me. Their eyes, their hands, their head, their féete, they frame in ſuch wiſe, as ſhall tend to ſome piece of obſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the lawe. Their winking, their nodding, their mouing, their croſſing, is all Gods ſeruice, as they do tell vs. But where is the heart? Where is the minde and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward puritie that God requireth? When they heare, Thou ſhalt not kyl: thou ſhalt not ſteale: thou ſhalt not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterie: The pureſt of them all, what do they?

Firſt with their chaſtity, they deſtroy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chaſtity y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God ordayned, &amp; only requireth. With their obedience, they take awaye the order that God in thys world hath ſet, and exacteth none other. With their pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they peruert humility, &amp; the true pouerty of the ſpirite, which Chriſt taught onely, which is onely, not to loue the worldly goodes. With their faſte, filling their vnſatiable paunches, they forget the faſt which God commaundeth, a perpetuall ſobreneſſe to tame the fleſhe. With their patte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of prayers, they haue put away the prayer that God hath taught vs, which is eyther thankes for benefites re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, or deſiring helpe, with truſt to be relieued. Their Croſſes, haue diſplaced Chriſt. Their pictures, haue defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Scripture. Their Lay mennes bokes, haue aboliſhed the lawe. Their holineſſe, is to forbyd that, which God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned to be receyued with thankes giuing: as meate, and Matrimony. Their owne workes they mayntayne: they let Gods decay. Breake theirs, and they perſecute to the death: Breake Gods, and they eyther loke thorowe their fyngers, or elſe giue a flappe wyth a Foxe tayle, for a little money. Then is it eaſy to be eſpied what they are. Let them dyſguiſe themſelues neuer ſo cloſely, yet by this exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of their natures and properties, they wyll bewray themſelues. Chriſoſtome commenting vpon the ſeauenth of Mathewe, ſayth: <hi>Si quis lupum cooperiat pelle ouina, quomodo cognoſcet eum, niſi aut per vocem, aut per actum. Quis inclinata deorſum balat: Lupus in aëra conuertit caput ſuum contra coelum, &amp; ſic vlulat.

<pb facs="tcp:7817:151"/> If any man (ſayth he) couer a wolfe with a ſhepes ſkin, how ſhall he know him, but by his voyce, or by his doing?

The Sarons, for the part that they poſſeſſed, were moſt Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Britons remayned Chriſtians: in ſo much that when Auguſtine came among them, he founde ſeauen by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprikes, and an Archbyſhoprike, beſide diuers and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry monaſteries: which all had faythful and learned prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, kéeping their flockes in moſt Godly order. Nor vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was the fayth extinguiſhed, where Auguſtine la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. For <hi>Ethelbert</hi> the king of Kent, (as <hi>Polydor</hi> writeth) was mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wel inſtructed, by a godly wife, that came out of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and a Chriſtian byſhop that attended on hir. But Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine when he came, in place of Idolatry planted ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and where religion was ſincerely taught, he labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what he could of a certayne ambitious proude heart to peruert it. For finding in the city of <hi>Bangor,</hi> a notable ſort of Monkes (not idle bellies as of late yeres they haue bene, but learned, and liuing of the ſweate of their browes) in ſo much that being deuided into ſeauen partes, there were no leſſe than thrée hundreth of a company: this Romiſhe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, required ſubiection of them: and further woulde haue enioyned them, to become ſeruitoures in preaching of the Goſpell, to their mortall enimies, the Saxons: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicions when they refuſed, <hi>Ethelbert</hi> the king, partely in Auſtins quarrel, partly of an olde grudge of his owne, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp the reſt of the Saxon kings, to make war vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So they came to Cheſter, wherein the religious people had aſſembled themſelues, and when the City was taken, there were twelue hundreth of the good men, moſt cruelly ſlayne. And where as their rage was not ſo quieted, but néedes they would come to deſtroy <hi>Bangor,</hi> the Britous confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates aſſembling themſelues, wythſtode them, and ſlewe

And although <hi>Beda</hi> reciteth the hiſtory ſomewhat otherwiſe, yet, his witneſſe proueth, that Auguſtine was much to blame, which wold ſo ſeriouſly contend about trifles. For what were the matters that he exacted. <hi>Primo vt eodem quo Romana eccleſia tempore, festum Paſchatis celebrare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: Secu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munibus ritibus &amp; caeremonijs cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Romanis in Baptiſmi ministerio vterentur: Tertio vt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municata opera, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munibus laboribus genti Angliae Euangelium praedicare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</hi> that is to ſay: Fyrſte that they ſhould celebrate the Eaſter feaſte at the ſame time, that the Church of Rome did. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily, that they ſhould vſe in miniſtration of baptiſme, the ſelfe ſame ceremonies wyth the Romaines. Thirdely, that they ſhould communicate their trauayles, that ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they ſhould take paynes together, in preaching of the Goſpell to the engliſhe nation. Theſe conditions, bycauſe they were not receyued, the people (as he ſayth) were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued. But in this behalfe, the wonderfull iudgemente of almighty God is worthy to be conſidered, that exercyſeth his people with plagues among: and although of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſometime he graunt them <hi>Alcyonia tempora,</hi> ſome little breathing whiles: yet tempeſts do ariſe anone, &amp; the croſſe accompanieth true Chriſtianitie: which in this age of the Church, wherein <hi>Gregorie</hi> (by ſurname the great) and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine of whome we laſt haue ſpoken liued, may well be ſene. For after the flouriſhing time of <hi>Conſtantinus,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in moſt liberty was graunted Chriſtians: after the learned age of Auguſtine and Ambroſe, when all good knowledge was at the ripeſt: ſodaynely enſued a ſtraunge and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table alteration, when for light, darkeneſſe: for Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, ceremonies: for learning, ignoraunce and barbaritie ſucceded. That if ye paſſe ſyx hundreth yeare after Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:7817:158"/> ye ſhall ſée nothing but cloud of ceremonies, darkening the ſunne of eternall truth: and a ſorte of wilworſhips, defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the true honor of the almighty God.

Where by the way ye may obſerue, that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, the elder they are, do grow the more. For where as Auguſtine brought in but a bare Croſſe, we haue recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not onely a Croſſe, but alſo a crucifix graued thereon: And whereas he caried a picture but paynted on a table, we haue the ſame carued and emboſſed. Auguſtine comming vnto them, that neuer had heard of Chriſt, politiquely deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſomewhat, wherewithal fyrſt he might féede their eyes: that afterward lending him their eares, he might inſtructe their hearts. Wherefore if this facte of his might be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by the ſtate and condition of the countrey: yet can not we in our Croſſe carying, haue the like pretence, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to vſe the like example. Notwithſtanding, his Litanie was good, and I maruell that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romiſh church is not at this day contented with the like. He came not in with <hi>Ora pro nobis,</hi> he made no interceſſion to ſaincts for vs: but onely ſong this ſwéete Litany. <hi>Deprecamur te Domine in omni miſericordia tua, vt auferatur furor &amp; ira tua a ciuitate ista, quia peccauimus.</hi> In all thy mercy we beſech thée O Lorde, that thy indignation and fury, may be taken away from this city, bycauſe we haue ſynned. Which Litanie of hys, if it be compared with ours, the ſelfe ſame thing ſhall be ſene in both. But the popiſh Litanie, as it is different from
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7817:158"/> this, ſo is it Idolatrous. Virgin Mary pray for vs, Peter pray for vs, Paule praye for vs. And ſo forth to Abbots, Monks, Hermits, Nuns, Friers, &amp; al to pray for vs. I may ſay to you, as Tertullian<note place="margin">Tetullianus in Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getico. ca. <hi>30</hi>

For the diuell hymſelfe hath ſo ill a name, that if he were neuer ſo déere to men, yet they would not profeſſe hym openly, nor call vpon hym by expreſſe wordes. Wherefore he doeth ſo daze the myndes of them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath gotten vnder hys rule, that they thynke with themſelues, they ſerue no man leſſe than the diuell: when he in dede, puls them cleane awaye from the worſhipping of God, and ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is in him, to make them partakers of hys vnhappy ſtate and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Therfore theſe wicked ſpirites, do lurke in ſhrines, in roodes, in Croſſes, in Images: and firſt of all peruerte the prieſtes, which are eaſieſt to be caught with bayte of a little gayne. Then worke they miracles. They appeare to men in diuerſe ſhapes: dyſquiete them when they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake: trouble them in their ſlepes: diſtorte their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: take away their health: afflicte them with diſeaſes: only to bryng them to ſome Idolatry. Thus whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue obtayned their purpoſe: that a leude affiaunce is repoſed, where it ſhould not, they enter (as it were) into a new leage, and trouble them no more. What do the ſimple people then? verely ſuppoſe, that the Image, the Croſſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thyng that they haue kneled and offered vnto, (the very diuell in dede) hath reſtored them health: whereas he dyd nothyng but leaue of to moleſt them, <hi>Hac eſt enim</hi> (as S.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7817:163"/> cure, that the diuels giue, when they leaue of their wrong and iniury. Nor truly, we can not iuſtly alleage, that ſuch thynges were done among the Gentiles only, nor yet only among the Iewes, (as we do reade it was.<note place="margin">Deu. 13.</note>) But among the Chriſtians, it both hath bene and ſhalbe ſo. S. Paul hath a notable place in his ſeconde Epiſtle to the Theſſalonians<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2.</note> the ſeconde Chap. The wycked man (ſayth the Apoſtle) ſhal be reuealed, whoſe comming is by the workyng of Satan, with all power and ſignes and lying wonders. And in all deceauableneſſe of vnrighteouſneſſe among them that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe. Wherby it is euident, that ſignes and wonders ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be wrought in the tyme of Antichriſt, that ſhalbe able to ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duce (if it be poſſible) the very elect. Haue we not warning in the goſpell, that ſome ſhall come to Chriſt after ſuche a ſort in the latter day, ſaying: <hi>Domine, domine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 7.</note> 
               <hi>non ne per no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men tuum prophetauimus? Et per non tuum daemonia eiecimus?

To whome God ſhall anſwere notwithſtanding: <hi>Neſcio vos.</hi> I knowe you not. So that it is not a ſufficiente proufe, to make the thing good, to ſay: that miracles were wrought by it. God doth abhorre adultery: yet by the acte of it, ſometyme doth he ſuffer a miracle to be done, in the conception, the generation, the brynging of the childe into lyfe. God is offended with theft, yet doth he ſuffer ſtollen bread to fede vs, whiche is onely the power of hys mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and ſecrete working. Nowe if ye gather, that the vſe of the Croſſe is commendable, bicauſe of miracles, done by it: by the ſame reaſon, the adulterer and théefe, maye defende and mayntayne theyr vnlawfull doings, bicauſe as great and greater miracles are wrought by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Notwithſtanding I know, ſome miracles are better than
<pb facs="tcp:7817:164"/> other ſome: and great difference there is betwixte them. Chriſt and hys Apoſtles wrought miracles: ſo dyd Symon Magus and other ſorcerers. But as Gods glory was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by them: ſo priuate gaine was ſoughte for in theſe. As, for the heauenly doctrine of Chriſt, a confirmation was fet from miracles: ſo is there no diueliſh ſuperſtition, but the ſame hath had ſtraunge wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders for it.

<pb facs="tcp:7817:168"/> And as for the thirde, ſhe kepte. Nowe to carry a thing in ſigne of honour, as it were in a triumph, is one thing: to make it a ſpeciall poynte of defence, another. A ſallet is one thing, and a cap another: an helmet, is one thing, and a crowne another. To ioyne a nayle vnto my bridle, is one thing, to make a brydle of a nayle, is another.

Which thrée you ſée how they were beſtowed One was put into an helmet, or into a crowne: another was annexed to a brydle, or elſe a bridle beaten out of it: The third was caſt into the bottome of the ſea. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I knowe not howe it commeth to paſſe, but euery one of theſe is extant to this day: and although the helmet be gone, the bridle conſumed, the ſea continueth: Yet the very ſelfe ſame nayles be come abrode agayne, and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as reliques.

            <p>The Scripture warneth vs, that in the latter dayes, there ſhall be ſtrong ſpirites of illuſion, ſo that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecte themſelues (if it be poſſible) may be ſeduced.

But on the other ſide, if it pleaſed God to vſe the ſigne of a Croſſe in dede, as a meane to worke ſome miracles in the worlde, yet is it no ſufficient cauſe, to confirme the hauing, much leſſe the honoring of it now. To mollifie the hartes of viſible and mortal men, God vſed viſible and mortall meanes: not to confirme a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to them, but to eſtabliſhe an honoure and ſeruiſe to hymſelfe. God ſpake vnto Moſes<note place="margin">Moſes</note> oute of a fyrye buſhe. Shall nowe the fyre or the buſhe be honored? A good cauſe is broughte, why God appeared in a buſhe,<note place="margin">Bushe.</note> rather than any thyng beſide: that the peoples eyes myghte teache them that, whiche their heartes and ſoules oughte to beleue. For the thornes of the buſhe, dyd ſignifie the ſinnes for whiche the lawe came.

            <p>As God voucheſafed to appeare in a mountayne, thereby to put vs in minde of hys heyghte, farre paſſing Princes and all worldly ſublimytie: ſo muſte we conſider the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe of our calling, and be wel aſſured, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch a hil muſt be climbed of vs, as hath all the earth ſubiecte vnderneth it.

There be other meanes to remembre Chriſt (as in the Preface I haue at large declared) than by laying .ij. ſtickes a Croſſe, or breaking the ayre with a thumb on my forehead.<note place="margin">Papiſts deny Chriſt.</note> Nor they deny Chriſt, which affirme him to be God, and therefore in Heauen ſeke him: but ſuch as make an Image of him, ſeuering thereby his diuinity from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, and only as man vpon earth honour him. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your hiſtory is yll applyed. <hi>Galeatius Maria</hi> (as your owne authour ſayth) being duke of Millain,<note place="margin">Paradinus in ſymbolis.</note> was a wicked tirant, a common rauiſher of all honeſt women, a violent
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7817:174"/> oppreſſor of al his ſubiects: therfore God ſtirred the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of ſome, to conſpire his death. And for the ſame cauſe the worde of that armes is, <hi>vel in ara,</hi> that God in euery place, yea to the altare it ſelfe: purſueth the reuenge vpon the vngodly. And therefore the man which otherwiſe ſtode in dreade of the Prince, was by another meane heartened. But God ſtirreth the hart of none, to work any vengeance on Chriſt his ſonne: therefore the compariſon is not like. Agayne <hi>Lampugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> gat him the liuely Image of the duke: we haue the Image I wote nere of whom: ſure the Image of Chriſt it is not: but in reſpect of the abuſe, a damnable Idoll. Then if the ſtriking at the Image of Chriſt, be ſigne that Chriſt himſelfe is hated: conſider with your ſelfe who is more faulty, who is more deſpitefully ſet herein? You, or we? We pecke at a ſtone or a piece of wood, which hath no likeneſſe in the world of Chriſt: you burne and butcher the liuely members of Chriſts owne body, the perfect coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfets of him departed hence. We pull downe the dumbe and the deafe Idols, the inſtruments of abuſe: you murder the ſaincts, you deſtroy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophets: you ſpite that any liueth honeſter than your ſelues. Who nowe (I beſeche you) be more enimies of Chriſt? Who be more like to fall into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacie? the ouerthrowers of Idols, or deſtroyers of ſainc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes? the myſlikers of a dead ſtocke or ſtone: or murtherers of quicke and liuing men? You requeſt me to tell you,<note place="margin">Folio. <hi>109.</hi> b.</note> 
               <hi>if a man come into a chambre of preſence, and plucke dovvne the cloth of eſtate, and breake the Princes armes in pieces, is it not his intent to haue the Prince depoſed?</hi> In déede ſir if the Prince haue ſet it vp, and giue commaundement that it ſhall there ſtande, it is too great an offence to breake it. But if the Prince haue proclaymed the contrary, that none ſhall preſume to drawe his armes, or ſet vp any cloth of eſtate for him: and yet notwithſtanding, ſome in deſpite or mockerie, ſhall hang vp a beggerly and ſtinking clout:
<pb facs="tcp:7817:175"/> or in ſteade of his royall armes, erecte ſome monument of reproufe and ſhame, if I came in place, I would pull it downe, and be the faythfuller ſubiecte for that. And this is the very ſtate of our cauſe. Chriſt and his Apoſtles (as I haue proued before) haue vtterly forbidden Images: there is no Croſſe, that hath any likeneſſe of our redemer on it. Chriſt hath taken order onely by his worde to be ſet forth vnto vs. Therefore the Croſſe of woode, ſtone or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, may wythout offence be remoued of vs. For it is not the cloth of eſtate of his: the armes and recogniſance of his kingdome: It is a wicked inuention of the Papiſtes, a crafty deluſion of the diuell: to ſupplant Chriſt, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the knowledge and true ſeruice of him.

But if preaching of Chriſt and hearing of his worde doe fayle vs: a ſory Croſſe can but delite our eyes, and ſtraight corrupt our heartes. The miracles that haue bene done, although they may in parte wythout any
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7817:176"/> ſhame, be doubted of: without any impudencie denyed: yet graunted to be true, muſt not be broughte for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of a Croſſe, leaſt the lyke be alleaged to make Symon Magus a Sainct. In dede we reade,<note place="margin">

Therfore your miracles, if they be falſe, be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueliſh: if they were true, yet now are impertinent.

               <hi>as though he could not vvorke any ſuch miracles?</hi> Why, we rather do aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it much, acknowledging that God with out ſuch externall meanes, is able to worke more effectes than theſe. Only beware you, leaſt by aſcribing to muche vnto the meane, ye be ignoraunt of the ende, and diſgrace the author. We ſée by experience, that vertues wroughte or ſo ſuppoſed to haue bene, by the ſigne of a Croſſe, hath cauſed ſenſing, knéeling, offering, and al kynde of wicked Idolatry to the Croſſe. And ſo, where Chriſt ſhould haue bene only praiſed, a piece of wood is honored. A good matter it is to receyue a benefite, and ſo acknowledge it. A vyle part it is to enioy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pleaſure of one mans trauail, &amp; beſtow the thankes vpon an other: yet ſo it falleth out among the ſuperſtitious. God worketh the miracle: they worſhip the meane. So dyd the children of fornication, among the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes of olde, whoſe mother had played the harlot, ſaying: I wyl go after my louers,<note place="margin">Oſe. 2.</note> that giue me my bread and my water, my wooll and my flax, myne oyle and my drinke.

Then that your ſelfe are very much to blame, in déeming amyſſe of them. For in aſmuch as they haue learned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> commaundements, they alſo of neceſſitie muſte obey the commaundementes. Thirdely, that all ſubiectes in the realme of Englande, all Chriſtians beſide, are in right good eaſe, for they can not ſynne. This is your reaſon M. Martiall, and not mine. For thus ye ſay: <hi>They haue learned the commaundement to haue no other God but him, then beleue they no other God but him, then ſerue they no other God but hym.</hi> By the ſame reaſon I may reply: The man that is baptiſed,<note place="margin">The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities thereof.</note> hath receyued the fayth, doth knowe the commaundement, Thou ſhalt not ſteale, Thou ſhalt not committe adulterie. Therfore there is none that is baptiſed, that can be a théefe or adulterer. The Iewes were circumciſed, they had the lawe, they knewe that they ought to haue no other Goddes but him: Therfore no Iewe that euer was Idolatrer.

Therefore Peters pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is general: to be ready alwayes, to giue an anſwere to euery man, that aſketh a reaſon of the hope that is in vs. This reaſon ye refuſe: ye kepe a byrd in the boſome, but it berayes the neſt. For impoſſible it is, that a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience in ſeruiſe of his God, ſhal in apparance do one thing, &amp; in effect another. And although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeruiſe acceptable vnto god, conſiſt in ſpirit &amp; in truth,<note place="margin">Ioan. 4.</note> as Chriſt himſelf pronounceth,

For which purpoſe, theſe extern actions are right neceſſary, to be witneſſes to the world, of our affecte within vs. Vnderſtand ye therfore, that as .ij. kindes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor be due to God: one ſpiritual, reſting in the heart: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corporal, conſiſting in outward geſture: So are there alſo .ij. kindes of Idolatry.

The ſecond, when the honor peculiar vnto god, is tranſfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a creature. In both theſe, ye Papiſts moſt haynouſly do offend. For ye think, that God which is a ſpirite, is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with your maſking &amp; externe pomp, wherin conſiſteth al Romiſh religion: and ſo by your owne text, ye be proued falſe worſhippers. Alſo by your knocking &amp; holding vp of hands before an Image, ye ſhew your ſelues whoſe ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes you are, abaſing your eſtate, &amp; ſeruing a creature. For the proufe whereof, bicauſe it more nerely concerneth our queſtion, let vs inquite what bonde we be entred in wyth God, to ſerue him as we ought. So ſhall we ſée, whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny outward &amp; bodily fact, may wel induce vs, to ſay or think any man an Idolatrer. The eternall God requireth at our hands, that his name be glorfied, both in our ſpirite and in our body, bycauſe that both be his. And if the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement did not extende ſo farre, yet reaſon doth conuince no leſſe. For in aſmuch as our bodies alſo be redéemed with the precious bloudſhed of Chriſt, what a ſhame is it, to haue them ſubiect ſtil vnto the Diuels ſeruiſe? Our ſoules to be Gods, our bodies to be the Diuels? Whereas our bodies ought to be the temples of the holy ghoſt, what abſurditie is this, to defile them with ſacriledge? Whereas our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are foreapointed to immortality and partaking of the glory of God, what wickedneſſe is this to attaynt them with Idolatrie? Paule, when he doth inuey agaynſt forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, vſeth this argument. Whereas our bodies are the
<pb facs="tcp:7817:199"/> members of Chriſt,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.</note> is it méete to make them the members of an harlot? And on like ſort I may anſwere you. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our bodies be the members of Chriſt, ſhall we cut them of from that body of his? ſhall we prophanate them wyth vnlawfull worſhipping?<note place="margin">1. Reg. 10. Rom. 11.</note> God when he would expreſſe the peculiar note of his faythful ſeruaunts, ſayth of them, that they bowed not the knée to Baall, nor with their mouth kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him. He might as wel haue ſaid, that they were not pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with ſuperſtition: they did not accompt Baall for a God. But to intimate vnto vs, that the inwarde affecte in this caſe ſuffiſeth not, he expreſſeth by name, the outward geſture as altogether impious. Wherefore howſoeuer we flatter our ſelues with an hidden opinion (ſo ſecret that our ſelues féele it not) yet the euident and apparaunt worke of capping &amp; knocking, bowing and knéeling, may diſproue our hearte to be well affected: and we by outwarde ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, trie and diſcerne a méere Idolatrer. When God by his Prophete would deſcribe his magnificence, and honor due to him:<note place="margin">Eſay. 45.</note> he ſayd, <hi>Viuo ego, mihi flectetur omne genu, &amp; omnis lingua iurabit mihi.</hi> I liue ſayth the Lord, Euery knée ſhal bowe to me, and euery tong ſhall ſweare to me. Thus the holy ghoſt by bowing of the knée, by profeſſion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth deſcribeth true worſhipping. But you M. Martiall, wyll haue neither good nor bad worſhipping to be iudged by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. A proper ſhift ye haue, when ye adore an Image &amp; créepe to the Croſſe, ſaying: You knowe that, to be but a piece of metal: you make not your prayers to that, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God alone, whome in ſpirite you worſhip, though your face peraduenture be turned to the Image. The ſelfe ſame pretexte had the Corinthians. For they reſorted to the feaſtes of Idols, not of ſuperſtition: They were to well inſtructed. And Paule in their perſon bringeth forth an excuſe for them:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Scimus quod Idolum nihil est.</hi> We knowe that an Idoll is nothing. We knowe that one God, one
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7817:199"/> Lorde and ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt, is to be honoured and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of vs. But did this ſatiſfy S. Paule? Nay. But he affirmed rather, that their inward perſuaſion and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded excuſe was nothing, in aſmuch as their example moued the weake to commit Idolatrie. For if any man, ſayth the Apoſtle, ſée thée which haſt knowledge, ſit at fable in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols temple, ſhall not the conſcience of him that is weake, be boldned to eate thoſe things which are ſacrificed to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les? And on like ſorte, you affirme, that an Image or a Croſſe is nothing. But when ye giue the outward reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, when ye adore it, will not the ſimple déeme greate vertue in it? ſhall not your knoweledge (whatſoeuer it is) be occaſion of your brothers fall, for whome Chriſt died? Wherfore ſyth adoration is ſo offenſiue, better it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to ſée Image while the world ſtandeth, that our brother be not offended. And this is S. Paules reaſon, &amp; not mine. As for your ſubtile and profound argument, drawen out of the bowels of your profeſſed lawe, whereby ye make a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous demonſtration,<note place="margin">Folio. <hi>130.</hi> a.</note> that there can be no due prouf of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie, in aſmuch as <hi>Confeſſion</hi> thereof is nothing credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Probation</hi> can not be made but by externall ſignes, &amp; they do onely enforce a preſumption, and as for <hi>euidence of the facte,</hi> it can not fall into effects of the minde, where the abhomination of Idolatry lieth: I anſwere, that although we be very ingenious to finde out excuſes for our owne of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, yet the euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the outward facte, maketh ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t probation of Idolatrie, and is too good a witneſſe of myſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning minde. For if the heart conceyued not, the bodie would not doe: &amp; if the body called the hart vnto accompt, I am ſure that at leaſt in the court of Chauncerie, where conſcience is examined, the heart ſhould be firſt condemned of myſgouernement. When Ezechias deſtroyed the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ſerpent, the Iewes lacked ſuch an aduocate as you, that might haue called the King into the law, and tried the caſe
<pb facs="tcp:7817:200"/> of iniuſtice agaynſt him, bycauſe he was not able to make proufe of any crime. For they would not confeſſe their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie: &amp; their knéeling to the Image, made (as you ſay) but onely a preſumption: and no euidence could be fet fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the outward fact, bycauſe ye ſuppoſe, there is no Idolatrie but ſecrete in the heart. But flatter your ſelues (as you beſt can) with your lurking affecte and priuy deuotion: your apparant impietie, ſhall not only to Godwarde but to the world condemne you. If Daniels companions had féeyed ſuch a counſellour, ſuch a lawyer as you: they would not haue throwen themſelues into ſuch extremitie, whereas they could not haue bene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uinced of Idolatrie, for al their knéeling before the Idol, if in hart they retained the honor and ſeruiſe of the liuing God. But they woulde not haue their bodies defiled with wicked worſhippings, nor of one temple make two Lordes: the ſoule to be Gods, the bodie to be Sathans. S. Paule of the outwarde conuerſation condemned the Corinthians as Idolatrers. <hi>1.</hi> Cor. <hi>8.</hi> S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alſo (as is before rehearſed) layde to his hearers charge, that they were worſe than the Egyptians, bycauſe of the external ſignes: God when he ſetteth forth the true ſeruiſe of himſelfe, maketh often mention of the outwarde reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Therfore (as you cal it) ſo is it in dede a poore iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of yours, that bycauſe God is worſhipped in ſpirite and in truth, therefore men falling before a piece of wood, knocking the breaſt, and holding vp the handes, may not in any wiſe be thought Idolatrers. Enrich (I beſéech you) this poore iudgement of yours, with better reaſon, or hold your tong for ſhame. As touching your wiſedome &amp; déepe diſcretion,<note place="margin">

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7817:200"/> are. And as for your owne part experience doth teach vs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. The iuggling of Papiſts, with Roodes and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, hath ſought by all meanes to plant an opinion of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; diuinitie to reſt in dead things. And howſoeuer you beleue of them, yet damnable is the ſeruiſe that you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund vnto them: and the more ye knowe the vile condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eſtate of them, the more iuſt and terrible is your condemnation, in exacting a worſhip &amp; adoration of them. Therefore I ſay with Paule. Bycauſe ye knowe God, and glorify him not as God, neyther are thankfull,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> but become vayne in your ymaginations, and your fooliſh heart is ful of darkeneſſe, when ye profeſſe your ſelues to be wiſe, ye be very fooles.</p>

               <l>Recorde alway in mindeful heart the Death of Chriſt thy Lord.</l>
               <l>This Death gaue Life, and he that dyed, did on his Croſſe alone</l>
               <l>Bring euerlaſting Life to thoſe that him beleue vpon.</l>
               <l>But though by meane of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his Croſſe this death was brought to paſſe,</l>
               <l>Yet ought not Croſſe in ſteade thereof to holde the ſacred place.</l>
               <l>A perfect triumph ouer Death this Death did once atchieue:</l>
               <l>But the materiall Croſſe to Life no help at all doth giue.</l>
               <l>This Death doth bring a full releaſe vnto the grieued minde:</l>
               <l>But in the framed Croſſe of wood no comfort is to finde.</l>
               <l>The markes of this moſt holſome Death the faithful hearts do beare:</l>
               <l>The marke of formed Croſſe, God wote, is but vntruſty geare.</l>
               <l>With godly men this Death for aye in honour ſhall abyde:</l>
               <l>Of godly men the ſhapen Croſſe is to be layde aſyde.</l>
               <l>Leaſt this good Death that bringeth Life ſhould flip out of our minde,</l>
               <l>He of his ſacred body hath his Supper left behinde.</l>
               <l>This as a pledge to ſtrength our ſoules is poynted to endure:</l>
               <l>And this alone ordayned is to be in dayly vre.</l>
               <l>Our Maſter Chriſt commaunded not the Croſſe be holden ſo:</l>
               <l>But where this Supper is in place the Croſſe may be let go.</l>
               <l>But of the Croſſe ſome monument if we deſire to ſée,</l>
               <l>The liuely members of our Chriſt to Croſſe ſtyll ſubiect be.</l>

               <l>If liuely ones want force ynough to moue our reſty minde:</l>
               <l>Alas in liueleſſe Signes what force of credite ſhall we finde?</l>
               <l>The faythfull ſorte content themſelues with Signes yſéene with eye,</l>
               <l>Euen while the Matter ſignified is wholly loſt thereby.</l>
               <l>So them, that ſhould by liuely Voyce haue learnde the truth to know,</l>
               <l>The forged Image euermore doth into errour throw.</l>
               <l>Shall they whome God that doth deſcende into the godly breſt,</l>
               <l>Doth not ſo make to call to minde the duetie they profeſt:</l>
               <l>Shall they forſoth in heart be brought to holde the ſame aright</l>
               <l>By fickle forme of Creature ſubiect to erring ſight?</l>
               <l>Yet is not here the ende of ylles. For hereof doth enſue</l>
               <l>From worſe effect falſe Worſhip done where it was neuer due.</l>
               <l>For after once a forme of Croſſe is made by workemans arte,</l>
               <l>To Stockes and Stones as heauenly Gods then honor they imparte.</l>
               <l>But if with precious Metall it be garniſht to the eye,</l>
               <l>A double Idoll of one Croſſe is honorde by and by.</l>
               <l>Let him therefore that Dyed on Croſſe deuoutly be adorde.</l>
               <l>And let materiall Croſſe be farre from vs that feare the Lorde.</l>
